## Background

I am an environmental data scientist, artist, and multidisciplinary problem-solver drawn to the intersection of cutting-edge technology and real-world impact. I believe the most powerful solutions emerge from genuine collaboration—combining technical rigor with creative thinking, local knowledge with satellite data, and scientific precision with human-centered design.

Currently a Master of Environmental Data Science student at UCSB (graduating June 2026), I'm working at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental justice. I'm equally excited about pursuing novel applications no one else is exploring yet—from using satellite imagery to document environmental change and support marginalized communities to understanding how nature can teach us sustainable design, to analyzing the impacts of infrastructure on ecosystems.

Being near the ocean isn't just preference—it's foundational to my well-being and how I work best. Creativity, challenge, and continuous learning aren't optional; they're how I thrive.

## Academic Journey

My academic journey began with a focus on pure mathematics, drawn to the elegance and precision of numerical analysis. My goal from the start was to use my degree to bring new levels of quantitative and analytical rigor to the science of understanding our world and place on this earth as a species. More broadly, my aim is to harness the constructive interference that arises from the combination of seemingly desperate modes of thinking.

### Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)

**University of California, Santa Barbara – Bren School** \| *Expected June 2026*

GPA: 4.0 • Leadership: MEDS Student Faculty Representative

Focus: Remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental data engineering. Currently working on water resource sustainability and irrigation systems in Sub-Saharan Africa through the Water Vegetation and Society (WaVeS) Lab.

### BS in Mathematics

**University of California, Santa Barbara** \| *June 2025*

GPA: 3.67 • Leadership: Undergraduate Outreach Officer for Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE)

Focus: Applied mathematics with emphasis on numerical analysis, linear algebra, and probability. Developed passion for using mathematical tools to understand environmental systems and data patterns.

### Associate of Science in Mathematics

**Sacramento City College** \| *June 2022*

GPA: 4.0

## Research Focus

My current research sits at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, and water resource sustainability. I'm working with the Water Vegetation and Society (WaVeS) Lab at UCSB on understanding irrigation patterns in Sub-Saharan Africa using satellite data analysis. I'm particularly interested in how cutting-edge technology can illuminate patterns that affect environmental and agricultural systems, and how this data can support better decision-making for communities and ecosystems.

### Biomimicry

Learning from nature is central to both my scientific outlook and personal worldview. I believe that true solutions come from respecting and integrating with the natural systems all around us. Biomimicry, to me, is about seeking guidance from nature’s intelligence—studying the processes and resilience of living systems, and exploring how these principles can inspire our own designs, behaviors, and mindsets. I strive to align my research and daily life with these lessons, drawing inspiration from the practices and wisdom of indigenous communities who have always lived in harmony with their environments. Biomimicry isn’t just an innovation strategy; it’s a path to personal, mental, and spiritual well-being by reconnecting with the natural world.

## Creative Practice

I believe that creativity and science amplify each other; discovery happens when boundaries are blurred and new perspectives collide. Whether I’m analyzing satellite data or experimenting with a blank canvas, I find that both art and science challenge me to notice subtle details, think in systems, and communicate in ways that spark curiosity and connection. When I’m not creating digitally, you’ll find me with paint on my clothes, camera in hand, or scribbling poetry about the weird beauty of real-world data, landscapes, and life at the edge of art and science.

## Community Involvement

Beyond the lab, I'm passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact in my local community and beyond.

### Founder & Lead Organizer – IV Recovery Community Initiative

**Goleta, CA** \| *2023 - Present*

I founded and lead the IV Recovery Community Initiative, organizing bi-weekly coastal cleanups that engage university students and community members in environmental stewardship. What started as a personal passion has grown into something beautiful: seeing people show up, roll up their sleeves, and realize they can make a tangible difference. By quantifying what we collect—from microplastics to fishing line to abandoned equipment—we make the invisible visible and build community responsibility for the land we occupy.

### Undergraduate Outreach Officer – Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE)

**University of California, Santa Barbara** \| *2024 - 2025*

Coordinated mentorship programs supporting 130+ undergraduate students pursuing STEM degrees, with focus on increasing diversity and representation in quantitative sciences and supporting retention of underrepresented students.

## Values & Mission

My work is guided by a few core values that I believe are essential for creating meaningful impact through data science:

### Environmental Justice

All communities deserve access to clean environments and the tools to protect them. My research prioritizes supporting communities that are often overlooked by traditional environmental monitoring.

### Community-Centered

The best research happens in partnership with the communities it's meant to serve. I prioritize collaborative approaches that respect local knowledge and ensure community benefit.

### Creative Innovation

Some of the best solutions come from unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. Whether I'm analyzing satellite data or painting, I bring the same habit of noticing patterns and asking "what if?" I believe that technical rigor and creative thinking amplify each other—science needs imagination, and art needs precision. The breakthrough ideas happen at the intersection.

### Transparent Science

Science should be open, reproducible, and accessible. I'm committed to transparent research practices and clear communication of complex concepts.

## What's Next

My post-MEDS journey will be guided by the problems that excite me and the values that drive my work. I'm pursuing opportunities where I can combine cutting-edge technology with real environmental and social impact. Some of the questions that keep me awake at night:

-   **How can satellite imagery document environmental harm and support indigenous land rights?** Using remote sensing as evidence for climate impacts, illegal activities, and the benefits of indigenous management practices.

-   **What does wildlife need to thrive?** Analyzing wildlife corridors, the impact of infrastructure, and using animal behavior to inform conservation design.

-   **How can we make environmental data work harder for people who need it?** Building live, accessible data systems—not outdated snapshots—that help water managers, farmers, and communities make better decisions.

-   **What can nature teach us?** Biomimicry isn't just buzzword—it's about genuinely learning from millions of years of evolutionary solutions: sustainable adhesion from mussels, effective ventilation from termites, wind turbines inspired by humpback whale fins.

-   **How does our disconnection from nature affect our mental and emotional health?** Exploring the links between environmental deprivation and well-being, and designing solutions that reconnect people to the natural world.

I'm looking for roles that let me **keep learning**, **try new things**, **stay near the ocean**, and **tackle problems that matter**. Whether that's working with NGOs, research institutions, government agencies, or social enterprises, I'm drawn to teams doing work that feels urgent and true.
