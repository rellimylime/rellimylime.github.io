  <h2>🌟 My Story</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm Emily, and I'm passionate about using data science to solve environmental challenges while never losing sight of the human stories behind the numbers. I believe that the most powerful research happens when we combine technical rigor with creative thinking and genuine care for the communities we serve.</p>
  
  <p>Currently, I'm a PhD student in Environmental Data Science at UCSB, where I'm turning pixels into policy by teaching computers to notice what we've been ignoring. My research uses satellite imagery and machine learning to track irrigation patterns and land use across Sub-Saharan Africa, but I'm equally excited about applying these tools to biodiversity conservation, wildlife corridors, and indigenous land rights.</p>
  
  <p>When I'm not staring at satellite images, you'll find me organizing beach cleanups in Isla Vista, painting abstract landscapes inspired by data patterns, or trying to convince my kelp-obsessed dog that there are other, more normal snacks available.</p>

  <h2>🎓 Academic Journey</h2>
  <p>I started my academic journey as a pure math major, convinced that numbers and equations were the only things that made sense in an otherwise chaotic world. But I quickly discovered that math could be applied to real problems — like tracking deforestation, predicting climate patterns, and understanding how humans interact with the environment.</p>

  <h2>🔬 Research Focus</h2>
  <p>My research sits at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental justice. I'm particularly interested in how we can use satellite imagery and AI to support communities that are often overlooked by traditional environmental monitoring approaches.</p>

  <h2>🎨 Creative Side</h2>
  <p>I believe that creativity and science aren't opposites — they're the same muscle flexing in different directions. When I'm not analyzing satellite imagery, you'll find me with paint on my hands, camera in hand, or scribbling poetry about the intersection of data and life.</p>

  <h2>🌊 Community Involvement</h2>
  <p>Beyond the lab, I'm passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact in my local community and beyond.</p>
  
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h3>Beach Cleanup Organizer</h3>
    <div class="blog-meta">Isla Vista, CA • 2022-Present</div>
    <p>I organize regular beach cleanups that bring together students, community members, and environmental enthusiasts. Our largest cleanup had 50+ volunteers and collected over 200 pounds of trash and microplastics. But the real impact isn't just in the numbers — it's in the conversations, the community connections, and the way data becomes a catalyst for change.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h3>Environmental Education</h3>
    <div class="blog-meta">Local Schools & Community Groups • 2023-Present</div>
    <p>I volunteer with local schools and community groups to teach environmental science and data literacy. My goal is to make complex environmental concepts accessible and engaging for people of all ages, showing them how data science can be a powerful tool for environmental protection.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h3>Research Collaboration</h3>
    <div class="blog-meta">International Partners • 2022-Present</div>
    <p>I work with researchers, NGOs, and local communities around the world to apply remote sensing and machine learning to environmental challenges. These collaborations ensure that my research has real-world impact and benefits the communities whose environments we're studying.</p>

  <h2>🐕 Personal Life</h2>
  <p>When I'm not working on research or organizing beach cleanups, I'm usually hanging out with my kelp-obsessed dog, who thinks seaweed is the world's best snack. We spend a lot of time at the beach (where else would we be?), and I've learned more about marine ecosystems from her food preferences than from any textbook.</p>
  
  <p>I'm also an avid reader, a terrible but enthusiastic surfer, and someone who believes that the best ideas come from unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated things. I collect rocks from beaches around the world, have a growing collection of vintage cameras, and am always looking for new ways to combine my love of data with my love of creativity.</p>
