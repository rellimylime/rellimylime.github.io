# Random Adventures

*Life happens between the data points*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What This Is All About

Welcome to the moments that live between the data points and outside the lab—the beautiful chaos, unexpected discoveries, and genuinely ridiculous moments that make up a life worth living. This is where I share the adventures, the daily wonder, and the goofy things that happen when you're paying attention to the world around you.

## Dog Adventures

Meet the star of most of my unplanned adventures: my ground-squirrel-chasing, seaweed-rolling, beach-loving pup who thinks she's part mermaid. She has perfected the art of finding the most spectacularly stinky kelp and rolling in it with the dedication of a connoisseur.

    -   **The Fragrance Connoisseur**\
        *Beach day • 2024*\
        She will find the most spectacularly stinky kelp and roll in it with the dedication of a perfume critic. Ten out of ten, would stink again.

    -   **Environmental Activist**\
        *Beach cleanup • 2024*\
        She may not understand why we're cleaning, but she's definitely helping—and enjoying every second of being at the beach with her people.

    -   **Research Companion**\
        *UCSB Research Lab • 2024*\
        When your lab assistant has four legs, unlimited enthusiasm, and absolutely no interest in the data you're analyzing.

## 🌊 Beach Life

Living near the ocean saves my life on the daily. The salt water is where ideas come alive, where I remember what matters, and where the best conversations happen.

    -   **Community Care**\
        *Beach cleanup • 2024*\
        When strangers become stewards, and an afternoon at the beach becomes an afternoon caring for home.

    -   **Golden Hour Wisdom**\
        *Evening beach walk • 2024*\
        The best conversations happen with your feet in the sand and the sky turning colors you can't quite name.

    -   **Accidental Creation**\
        *Low tide creativity • 2024*\
        Art happens when we're not trying. The ocean has its way of reminding us that creation is everywhere—we just have to show up and play.
