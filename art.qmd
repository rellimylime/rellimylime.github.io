  <h2>üåà My Creative Philosophy</h2>
  <p>I believe that art and science aren't opposites ‚Äî they're different ways of seeing the same beautiful, complex world. When I'm not analyzing satellite imagery, you'll find me with paint on my hands, camera in hand, or scribbling poetry about the intersection of data and life.</p>
  
  <p><em>"The best data visualizations are art, and the best art tells a story with the precision of good data."</em></p>

    <h3>Satellite Dreams</h3>
    <div class="blog-meta">Written during a late night analyzing irrigation patterns ‚Ä¢ 2024</div>
    <p><em>
    From space, the Earth is a canvas<br>
    of green and brown and blue<br>
    I trace the lines of human need<br>
    across the satellite view<br><br>
    
    Each pixel tells a story<br>
    of water, soil, and sun<br>
    of farmers and their families<br>
    of work that's never done<br><br>
    
    I teach the computer to see<br>
    what we've been ignoring<br>
    turning terabytes into hope<br>
    and data into caring

    <h3>Kelp Dog Ode</h3>
    <div class="blog-meta">Inspired by my dog's seaweed obsession ‚Ä¢ 2024</div>
    <p><em>
    My dog thinks kelp is the world's best snack<br>
    she'll eat it fresh or dried<br>
    from the beach or from the water<br>
    with uncontainable pride<br><br>
    
    I tell her it's not normal<br>
    but she doesn't seem to care<br>
    she's found her perfect food<br>
    and it's everywhere<br><br>
    
    Maybe she knows something<br>
    about the ocean's gifts<br>
    that we humans are still learning<br>
    as our understanding shifts

    <h3>Data Becomes Action</h3>
    <div class="blog-meta">After organizing my first big beach cleanup ‚Ä¢ 2023</div>
    <p><em>
    We started with numbers<br>
    plastic pieces counted<br>
    beach surveys conducted<br>
    data points mounted<br><br>
    
    But numbers don't clean beaches<br>
    or change human hearts<br>
    so we put down our spreadsheets<br>
    and picked up our parts<br><br>
    
    Fifty people showed up<br>
    with gloves and with hope<br>
    proving that data becomes action<br>
    when we stop being spectators<br>
    and start being scope
