    "text": "Marine aquaculture represents a critical opportunity for sustainable food production as global seafood demand continues to rise. Unlike land-based meat production, marine aquaculture can provide protein with lower environmental costs when strategically located in suitable environments (Hall et al. 2011). Recent research has demonstrated that global seafood demand could theoretically be met using less than 0.015% of the global ocean area (Gentry et al. 2017), highlighting the importance of identifying optimal locations for development.\nThe US West Coast, with its diverse marine ecosystems and extensive Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), presents significant potential for marine aquaculture expansion. However, successful aquaculture operations depend largely on environmental conditions, particularly sea surface temperature and water depth, which determine species survival and growth rates.\n\n\n\nThis analysis evaluates the potential for marine aquaculture along the US West Coast by identifying EEZs with suitable environmental conditions for two commercially important species: oysters (Crassostrea spp.) and black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii). Using geospatial analysis of satellite-derived sea surface temperature and bathymetry data, we address three key questions:\n\nWhich West Coast EEZs have the largest areas of suitable conditions for oyster aquaculture?\nWhich regions are most suitable for black abalone cultivation?\nHow do suitability patterns differ between these two species?\n\nBy developing a generalizable workflow, this analysis can be applied to assess aquaculture potential for additional species, supporting evidence-based decision-making for sustainable marine resource development."

    "text": "Data and Methods\n\nSetup and Required Packages\nThis analysis uses several R packages for geospatial data processing and visualization:\n\ntidyverse — Data manipulation and visualization\nsf — Spatial vector data handling\nterra — Raster data processing\ntmap — Thematic mapping\nkableExtra — Table formatting\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(testthat)\n\n\n\n\nData Sources\n\nExclusive Economic Zones (EEZ)\nWe use maritime boundary data for the US West Coast EEZs, which define the regions where the United States has rights to explore and exploit marine resources (Flanders Marine Institute 2024). The shapefile includes boundaries for California (Northern, Central, and Southern), Oregon, and Washington.\n\n\nCode\n# Load West Coast EEZ shapefile\nwc_df &lt;- st_read(\"data/wc_regions_clean.shp\")\n\n# Check CRS\nst_crs(wc_df)$epsg\n\n\nThe EEZ data uses EPSG:4326 (WGS 84), a geographic coordinate reference system.\n\n\nSea Surface Temperature (SST)\nAverage annual sea surface temperature data from 2008-2012 provides a multi-year baseline for identifying thermally suitable aquaculture locations (NOAA Coral Reef Watch 2024). The data comes from NOAA’s 5km Daily Global Satellite Sea Surface Temperature product, aggregated to annual averages and provided in degrees Kelvin.\n\n\nCode\n# Load SST rasters for 2008-2012\n\n# Define a function to read rast\nread_tif &lt;- function(year) {\n  rast(file.path(\"data\", paste0(\"average_annual_sst_\", year, \".tif\")))\n}\n\n# Apply function\nsst_list &lt;- lapply(2008:2012, read_tif)\n\n# Combine into raster stack\nsst_stack &lt;- rast(sst_list)\n\n# Inspect properties\nnames(sst_stack)\nst_crs(sst_stack[\"average_annual_sst_2008\"])\nsummary(values(sst_stack))\nglobal(sst_stack, fun = \"isNA\")\n\n\nWe’ve loaded 5 years of annual SST data and combined them into a raster stack for further processing.\n\n\nBathymetry (Depth)\nOcean depth data comes from the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) 2022 Grid (GEBCO Compilation Group 2022), providing global bathymetric measurements. Depth is a critical parameter for aquaculture site selection as different species have specific depth requirements based on their feeding behavior, oxygen requirements, and substrate preferences.\n\n\nCode\n# Load depth raster\ndepth &lt;- rast((\"data/depth.tif\"))\n\n# Check properties\nst_crs(depth)\n\n\nThe bathymetry data also uses EPSG:4326, matching our SST and EEZ data.\n\n\n\nVerifying Coordinate Reference Systems\nBefore proceeding with spatial analysis, we must ensure all datasets share a common coordinate reference system (CRS). Spatial operations like overlays and intersections will fail or produce incorrect results if the CRS doesn’t match.\n\n\nCode\n# Check sst crs\ncrs(sst_stack, describe = TRUE)$code\n\n# Set epsg explicitly from metadata\ncrs(sst_stack) &lt;- \"EPSG:4326\"\n\n# Check again\ncrs(sst_stack, describe = TRUE)$code\n\n# Check extent makes sense for this CRS\next(sst_stack)\n\n# Verify sst and depth crs are the same\ncrs(sst_stack) == crs(depth)\n\n# Check if wc_df crs matches\ncrs(sst_stack, describe = TRUE)$code == st_crs(wc_df)$epsg\n\n\nAll three datasets (SST, depth, and EEZ boundaries) now use EPSG:4326 (WGS 84), ensuring compatibility for subsequent spatial operations.\n\n\nData Processing Workflow\n\nStep 1: Calculate Mean SST (2008-2012)\nTo create a stable baseline for identifying suitable temperatures, we calculate the mean SST across all five years (2008-2012). This multi-year average reduces the influence of short-term temperature anomalies and provides a more representative measure of typical thermal conditions.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate mean SST across all years using app()\nsst_mean &lt;- app(sst_stack, mean, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Visualize with plot()\nplot(sst_mean, main = \"Mean Sea Surface Temperature (2008-2012)\")\n\n\nThe spatial pattern shows a clear north-south temperature gradient along the West Coast, with cooler waters in the north (Washington/Oregon) and warmer waters in Southern California.\n\n\nStep 2: Convert SST from Kelvin to Celsius\nThe NOAA SST data is provided in degrees Kelvin. For easier interpretation and to match species requirement data (which uses Celsius), we convert to degrees Celsius by subtracting 273.15.\n\n\nCode\n# Convert from Kelvin to Celsius (subtract 273.15)\nsst_mean_c &lt;- sst_mean - 273.15\n\n# Extract values as vector and calculate summary statistics\nsst_values &lt;- as.vector(values(sst_mean_c))\nsst_values &lt;- sst_values[!is.na(sst_values)]\n\n# Create summary statistics table\ntemp_summary &lt;- data.frame(\n  Statistic = c(\"Minimum\", \"1st Quartile\", \"Median\", \"Mean\", \"3rd Quartile\", \"Maximum\"),\n  Temperature_C = round(c(\n    min(sst_values),\n    quantile(sst_values, 0.25),\n    median(sst_values),\n    mean(sst_values),\n    quantile(sst_values, 0.75),\n    max(sst_values)\n  ), 2)\n)\n\nkable(temp_summary,\n      caption = \"Summary Statistics for Mean SST (2008-2012) in °C\",\n      col.names = c(\"Statistic\", \"Temperature (°C)\"),\n      align = c(\"l\", \"r\")) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"),\n                full_width = FALSE,\n                position = \"left\")\n\n\n\nSummary Statistics for Mean SST (2008-2012) in °C\n\n\nStatistic\nTemperature (°C)\n\n\n\n\nMinimum\n4.98\n\n\n1st Quartile\n12.38\n\n\nMedian\n14.07\n\n\nMean\n14.16\n\n\n3rd Quartile\n16.06\n\n\nMaximum\n32.89\n\n\n\n\n\nThe temperature range along the West Coast spans approximately 8-21°C, which falls within the thermal tolerance of many marine aquaculture species.\n\n\nStep 3: Align Depth Data with SST\nTo perform raster algebra (combining temperature and depth layers), we need the rasters to have identical spatial properties: extent, resolution, and CRS. The depth and SST rasters currently have different resolutions and extents, so we crop and resample the depth data to match the SST grid.\n\n\nCode\n# Crop depth to SST extent using crop()\ndepth_crop &lt;- crop(depth, sst_mean_c)\n\n# Resample depth to match SST resolution using resample() with method = \"near\"\ndepth_resampled &lt;- resample(depth_crop, sst_mean_c, method = \"near\")\n\n# Verify alignment\nres(depth_resampled) == res(sst_mean_c)\next(depth_resampled) == ext(sst_mean_c)\ncrs(depth_resampled) == crs(sst_mean_c)\n\n\nWe use the “nearest neighbor” resampling method, which is appropriate for preserving discrete depth values without interpolation artifacts. The depth and SST rasters are now perfectly aligned."

Based on data from SeaLifeBase (Palomares, M.L.D. and D. Pauly 2024), oysters require:\n\nSea surface temperature: 11-30°C\nDepth: 0-70 meters below sea level\n\nThese requirements reflect oyster’s tolerance for relatively warm waters and their preference for shallow to moderate depths where food availability is high and substrate is accessible.\n\n\nSuitability Mapping\nWe use binary reclassification to identify areas meeting both temperature and depth criteria. For each environmental layer, cells within the suitable range are assigned a value of 1, while unsuitable cells receive 0. Multiplying the two layers together produces a final suitability map where only locations meeting both criteria receive a value of 1.\n\n\nCode\n# Reclassify SST for oysters using classify()\n# Create rcl matrix: &lt;11°C = 0, 11-30°C = 1, &gt;30°C = 0\nsst_rcl_mat_oyster &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, 11, 0,\n                                11, 30, 1,\n                                30, Inf, 0),\n                              ncol = 3,\n                              byrow = TRUE)\n\nsst_rcl_oyster &lt;- classify(sst_mean_c, sst_rcl_mat_oyster)\n\n# Reclassify depth for oysters using classify()\n# Create rcl matrix: &lt;-70m = 0, -70m to 0m = 1, &gt;0m = 0\ndepth_rcl_mat_oyster &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, -70, 0,\n                                 -70, 0, 1,\n                                 0, Inf, 0),\n                               ncol = 3,\n                               byrow = TRUE)\n\ndepth_rcl_oyster &lt;- classify(depth_resampled, depth_rcl_mat_oyster)\n\n# Combine suitability layers\nsuitable_zones_oyster &lt;- sst_rcl_oyster * depth_rcl_oyster\n\n# Visualize with plot()\nplot(suitable_zones_oyster,\n     main = \"Oyster Suitability\\n(1 = Suitable, 0 = Unsuitable)\",\n     cex.main = 0.9,\n     col = c(\"gray90\", \"darkgreen\"))\n\n\nThe map reveals extensive suitable habitat for oysters along the West Coast, particularly in California’s coastal waters where temperatures and depths align with oyster requirements.\n\n\n\nBlack Abalone (Haliotis cracherodii) Suitability\n\nSpecies Requirements\nBlack abalone is a marine gastropod native to the Pacific coast, historically important both ecologically and commercially. However, the species has experienced significant population declines and is now listed as endangered. Understanding suitable habitat is crucial for both aquaculture development and conservation planning. Based on SeaLifeBase (Palomares, M.L.D. and D. Pauly 2024), black abalone requires:\n\nSea surface temperature: 12.2-18.6°C\nDepth: 0-6 meters below sea level\n\nThese narrower requirements reflect black abalone’s preference for cool, shallow rocky intertidal and subtidal zones typical of the California coastline.\n\n\nSuitability Mapping\nWe apply the same binary reclassification approach used for oysters, but with black abalone’s more restrictive temperature and depth ranges.\n\n\nCode\n# Reclassify SST for black abalone using classify()\n# Suitable: 12.2-18.6°C = 1, Unsuitable: &lt;12.2°C or &gt;18.6°C = 0\nsst_rcl_mat_abalone &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, 12.2, 0,\n                                 12.2, 18.6, 1,\n                                 18.6, Inf, 0),\n                               ncol = 3,\n                               byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Apply reclassification matrix to mean SST raster\nsst_rcl_abalone &lt;- classify(sst_mean_c, sst_rcl_mat_abalone)\n\n# Reclassify depth for black abalone using classify()\n# Suitable: 0-6m below sea level = -6 to 0 in raster values\ndepth_rcl_mat_abalone &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, -6, 0,\n                                   -6, 0, 1,\n                                   0, Inf, 0),\n                                 ncol = 3,\n                                 byrow = TRUE)\n\n# Apply reclassification matrix to resampled depth raster\ndepth_rcl_abalone &lt;- classify(depth_resampled, depth_rcl_mat_abalone)\n\n# Combine suitability layers\nsuitable_zones_abalone &lt;- sst_rcl_abalone * depth_rcl_abalone\n\n# Visualize with plot()\nplot(suitable_zones_abalone,\n     main = \"Black Abalone Suitability\\n(1 = Suitable, 0 = Unsuitable)\",\n     cex.main = 0.9,\n     col = c(\"gray90\", \"darkblue\"))\n\n\nThe map shows much more limited suitable habitat for black abalone compared to oysters, with suitable areas concentrated in central California where temperatures remain within the narrow thermal window and very shallow depths occur."

    "section": "Key Findings",
    "text": "Key Findings\n\nOyster Aquaculture Potential\nOysters demonstrate substantial aquaculture potential across the US West Coast, with over 11,000 km² of suitable habitat identified across all five EEZ regions:\n\nCentral California: 4,069.88 km² — Leads the West Coast with the largest suitable area\nSouthern California: 3,757.28 km² — Second highest potential\nWashington: 2,378.31 km² — Significant northern habitat\nOregon: 1,074.27 km² — Moderate potential\nNorthern California: Minimal suitable area\n\nThese three top regions (Central CA, Southern CA, and Washington) together account for over 90% of all suitable oyster habitat on the West Coast. The broad temperature tolerance (11-30°C) and moderate depth range (0-70m) enable oysters to thrive across diverse coastal environments.\n\n\nBlack Abalone Aquaculture Potential\nBlack abalone presents a stark contrast, with only 199.88 km² of suitable habitat total—approximately 50 times less than oysters:\n\nCentral California: 152.37 km² — Dominates with 76% of all suitable habitat\nWashington: 26.65 km² — Limited northern habitat\nSouthern California: 20.86 km² — Small suitable area\nOregon & Northern California: Essentially no suitable habitat (0 km²)\n\nThis dramatic restriction reflects black abalone’s narrow thermal tolerance (12.2-18.6°C) and very shallow depth requirement (0-6m below sea level). The species is geographically constrained to cool, shallow coastal waters predominantly found in Central California.\n\n\nComparative Analysis\nThe 50-fold difference in suitable habitat between oysters and black abalone highlights how species-specific environmental requirements shape aquaculture potential:\n\nTemperature breadth: Oysters tolerate an 19°C temperature range vs. only 6.4°C for black abalone\nDepth tolerance: Oysters can inhabit depths to 70m vs. only 6m for black abalone\nGeographic distribution: Oysters have viable habitat in all West Coast EEZs; black abalone is restricted to 3 regions with 76% concentrated in one"

Pauly 2024); may not reflect full physiological tolerance ranges, life-stage-specific needs, or acclimation potential\nHabitat quality: Binary suitability (suitable/unsuitable) doesn’t capture gradient of habitat quality or productivity potential\nSubstrate requirements: Ignores seafloor characteristics (rocky vs. sandy), which strongly influence settlement and growth\n\n\n\nPractical Constraints\n\nSocioeconomic factors: Excludes proximity to processing facilities, markets, and infrastructure; conflicts with fishing, shipping, recreation, conservation areas; and complex regulatory/permitting landscapes\nSpatial resolution: Bathymetry resolution (~500m pixels) may be too coarse for shallow-water species like black abalone, where micro-scale depth variation matters"

Understanding which road and landscape characteristics predict roadkill hotspots enables evidence-based mitigation. We analyze ~11,000 roadkill events on 241,000 Danish road segments (2017-2019) to test whether traffic volume, forest proximity, and urban development predict collision rates.\nThe puzzle: Some roads experience frequent wildlife collisions while others have zero incidents. Is it just random chance or collection bias? Or are there systematic patterns we can identify and address?\nIf we can predict which roads are most likely to become collision hotspots, transportation planners and conservationists can install wildlife crossings, implement warning systems, or adjust speed limits in high-risk areas.\n\n\nHow do traffic volume and land use characteristics affect wildlife-vehicle collisions on Danish roads?\nSpecifically, we investigate two processes:\n\nOccurrence: What makes roadkill more likely to happen at all on a given road segment?\nIntensity: Once roadkill does occur, what factors influence how many collision events happen?\n\nThe high proportion of road segments with zero observed roadkill (~83%) suggests these processes operate differently, making a hurdle model the appropriate statistical framework."

I’ll go deep on something, get really good at it, then find something new and dive in headfirst. I’ve learned to stop seeing this as a failure and start seeing it as just… how my brain works. Everything I learn somehow feeds back into my actual passions anyway—the work and the wild."

Conservation, restoration, understanding how humans and ecosystems actually talk to each other—that’s where I’m headed. It’s not about being “green” or performing environmentalism. It’s about the genuine belief that nature is both the most complex system we need to understand and the best teacher we have.\nI also believe that creativity and precision aren’t opposites—they’re dance partners. You need both to do anything worth doing."

I’m working with the Water Vegetation and Society (WaVeS) Lab at UCSB on understanding irrigation patterns in Sub-Saharan Africa using satellite data analysis. I’m particularly interested in how cutting-edge technology can illuminate patterns that affect environmental and agricultural systems, and how this data can support better decision-making for communities and ecosystems.\n\nBiomimicry\nLearning from nature is central to both my scientific outlook and personal worldview. I believe that true solutions come from respecting and integrating with the natural systems all around us. Biomimicry, to me, is about seeking guidance from nature’s intelligence—studying the processes and resilience of living systems, and exploring how these principles can inspire our own designs, behaviors, and mindsets. I strive to align my research and daily life with these lessons, drawing inspiration from the practices and wisdom of indigenous communities who have always lived in harmony with their environments. Biomimicry isn’t just an innovation strategy; it’s a path to personal, mental, and spiritual well-being by reconnecting with the natural world."

I’m pursuing opportunities where I can combine cutting-edge technology with real environmental and social impact. Some of the questions that keep me awake at night:\n\nHow can satellite imagery document environmental harm and support indigenous land rights? Using remote sensing as evidence for climate impacts, illegal activities, and the benefits of indigenous management practices.\nWhat does wildlife need to thrive? Analyzing wildlife corridors, the impact of infrastructure, and using animal behavior to inform conservation design.\nHow can we make environmental data work harder for people who need it? Building live, accessible data systems—not outdated snapshots—that help water managers, farmers, and communities make better decisions.\nWhat can nature teach us? Biomimicry isn’t just buzzword—it’s about genuinely learning from millions of years of evolutionary solutions: sustainable adhesion from mussels, effective ventilation from termites, wind turbines inspired by humpback whale fins.\nHow does our disconnection from nature affect our mental and emotional health? Exploring the links between environmental deprivation and well-being, and designing solutions that reconnect people to the natural world.\n\nI’m looking for roles that let me keep learning, try new things, stay near the ocean, and tackle problems that matter.

These are filled with zero to prevent visualization errors.\n\n\n\nTrue Color Visualization\nBefore creating specialized visualizations, we can verify our data by creating a true color image using the red, green, and blue bands—similar to how a standard camera would capture the scene.\n\n\nCode\n# Create true color composite with robust scaling\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True)\nplt.title('True Color Image - Landsat 8')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue color composite (RGB) of the fire-affected area\n\n\n\n\n\nThe robust=True parameter clips extreme outlier values to improve visualization, preventing a few bright pixels from washing out the entire image.\n\n\n\nFalse Color Analysis\nFalse color composites use non-visible wavelengths to reveal features invisible to the human eye. By assigning shortwave infrared (SWIR) to red, near-infrared (NIR) to green, and red to blue, we create an image where healthy vegetation appears bright green and burned areas show distinct reddish-brown tones.\n\n\nCode\n# Create false color composite (SWIR/NIR/Red)\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True)\nplt.title('False Color Composite (SWIR/NIR/Red)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse color composite (SWIR/NIR/Red) highlighting burn scars\n\n\n\n\nWhy this band combination?\n\n\nHealthy vegetation has high NIR reflectance and low SWIR reflectance → appears bright green\nBurned areas have low NIR reflectance and moderate SWIR reflectance → appears reddish-brown\nUrban areas show moderate reflectance across bands → appears in neutral tones\n\n\n\n\nCreating the Final Map\nTo provide geographic context, we overlay the fire perimeters onto our false color image. This requires reprojecting the vector data to match the raster’s coordinate system (EPSG:32611 - UTM Zone 11N).\n\n\nCode\n# Reproject fire perimeters to match Landsat CRS\neaton = eaton.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\npalisades = palisades.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\n\n# Create comprehensive map\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (12, 12))\n\n# Plot false color composite\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(\n    ax = ax,\n    robust = True,\n    add_colorbar = False\n)\n\n# Overlay fire perimeters\neaton.boundary.plot(ax = ax, edgecolor = 'yellow', linewidth = 2, label = 'Eaton Fire')\npalisades.boundary.plot(ax = ax, edgecolor = 'red', linewidth = 2, label = 'Palisades Fire')\n\n# Add labels and formatting\nplt.title('Eaton and Palisades Fires - False Color Analysis',\n          fontsize = 20, fontweight = 'bold', pad = 20)\nplt.legend(loc = 'upper right', fontsize = 14)\nax.set_xlabel('Easting (meters)', fontsize = 14)\nax.set_ylabel('Northing (meters)', fontsize = 14)\n\n# Add fire name annotations\nax.text(eaton.geometry.centroid.x.values[0],\n        eaton.geometry.centroid.y.values[0] - 2700,\n        'Eaton Fire',\n        color = 'black', fontsize = 14, fontweight = 'bold',\n        bbox = dict(boxstyle = 'round', facecolor = 'white', alpha = 0.7))\n\nax.text(palisades.geometry.centroid.x.values[0] - 22000,\n        palisades.geometry.centroid.y.values[0] + 8000,\n        'Palisades Fire',\n        color = 'black', fontsize = 14, fontweight = 'bold',\n        bbox = dict(boxstyle = 'round', facecolor = 'white', alpha = 0.7))\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse color composite with fire perimeter overlays\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Interpretation\nThis false color composite displays the Eaton and Palisades fire areas captured by Landsat 8 on February 23, 2025. The image uses shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to highlight burn scars and vegetation health.\nKey features:\n\n\nBright green areas = Healthy vegetation (high NIR reflectance)\nReddish-brown areas = Burned areas and bare soil (low NIR, moderate SWIR)\nUrban/developed areas = Neutral tones (moderate reflectance across bands)\n\n\nThe fire perimeters are overlaid in yellow (Eaton Fire) and red (Palisades Fire) to delineate the official burn boundaries. This false color combination is particularly effective for assessing fire severity and monitoring landscape recovery, as the spectral signatures of healthy vs. burned vegetation are distinctly different in the infrared wavelengths."

Both the EJI data and fire perimeters use EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) coordinate reference system.\n\n\n\nIdentifying Affected Communities\nTo understand which communities were directly impacted by the fires, we use spatial intersection operations to identify census tracts that overlap with the fire perimeters. We then clip these tracts to the exact fire boundaries, ensuring our analysis focuses only on the areas that experienced direct fire impacts rather than nearby unaffected regions.\n\n\nAnalyzing Socioeconomic Vulnerability\nThe Environmental Justice Index includes percentile rankings for various vulnerability indicators.

    "section": "Key Findings",
    "text": "Key Findings\nThis analysis reveals stark racial and ethnic disparities in wildfire impacts between the two fire areas. The maps show percentile rankings of minority population (persons of color) within fire-affected census tracts, where higher percentile values indicate greater representation of minority residents relative to other California communities.\nPalisades Fire Area:\n\nThe affected census tracts show predominantly low percentile rankings (pale yellow colors, roughly 0th-30th percentiles). The Palisades fire primarily impacted areas with very low proportions of minority residents—reflecting the area’s demographics as a predominantly white, affluent coastal community.\n\nEaton Fire Area:\n\nThe burn area shows dramatically higher percentile rankings, with vast portions in the 70th-100th percentiles (dark red). Nearly the entire Eaton fire footprint, particularly around Altadena, shows the highest minority population rankings in the state. The Eaton fire overwhelmingly affected communities of color.\n\nEnvironmental Justice Implications:\nThis stark geographic pattern reveals that wildfire impacts are deeply tied to historical patterns of segregation and structural inequality. Communities of color—who already face compounded environmental burdens, reduced access to resources, and barriers to recovery—bore the brunt of the Eaton fire’s destruction. This disparity is critical for:\n\n\nEmergency response - ensuring equitable resource distribution during active disasters\nRecovery assistance - directing aid to communities facing systemic barriers to rebuilding\nLong-term planning - addressing how climate disasters compound existing racial inequities"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis demonstrates the power of integrating remote sensing techniques with environmental justice data to understand wildfire impacts through both physical and social lenses. The false color analysis using Landsat 8 imagery reveals the spatial extent and severity of burn scars across the landscape, while the environmental justice analysis uncovers critical disparities in who bears the burden of these disasters.\nThe stark contrast between the two fires—with Eaton disproportionately affecting economically vulnerable communities in the Altadena area while Palisades primarily impacted wealthier coastal neighborhoods—underscores the unequal distribution of climate disaster impacts. Communities with higher percentile rankings of low-income residents face compounded challenges: limited financial reserves for evacuation and temporary housing, reduced access to insurance, barriers to navigating recovery bureaucracy, and fewer resources for long-term rebuilding.\nThe combination of xarray, rioxarray, and geopandas provides a robust Python-based workflow for this critical multi-dataset geospatial analysis. By processing satellite imagery alongside census-based vulnerability data, we can identify not just where fires burned, but whose communities bore the burden—information essential for equitable resource allocation and recovery planning.\nAs climate change drives increased wildfire frequency and intensity across California and the Western United States, these integrated analytical approaches become indispensable tools for disaster response, recovery planning, and climate justice advocacy. Making both the physical and social dimensions of wildfire impacts visible empowers decision-makers to support vulnerable communities more effectively and challenges us to address the structural inequities that make some populations disproportionately vulnerable to environmental disasters."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\n\nThe 2021 Texas Winter Storm Crisis\nThe February 2021 winter storm, known as Winter Storm Uri, exposed critical vulnerabilities in Texas’s isolated power grid. Unlike other states, Texas operates its own grid (ERCOT), which is not connected to neighboring states, limiting backup power options during emergencies. The unprecedented cold caused natural gas pipelines to freeze, wind turbines to ice over, and power plants to fail, creating a cascading crisis.\nWhile the blackouts affected millions of Texans, their impacts were not uniformly distributed. Previous research on climate disasters has shown that low-income communities and communities of color often experience disproportionate impacts from extreme weather events. These communities may face longer recovery times, limited access to emergency resources, and inadequate infrastructure.\n\n\nRemote Sensing for Disaster Assessment\nSatellite-based night lights data provides a powerful tool for assessing power outages at scale. NASA’s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) captures daily nighttime light emissions, allowing researchers to detect changes in electrical grid function. By comparing light intensity before and after disasters, we can identify affected areas without relying solely on utility company reports, which may be incomplete during major crises.\nThis analysis combines VIIRS night lights data with OpenStreetMap building footprints and U.S. Census socioeconomic data to map blackout impacts and explore potential environmental justice dimensions of the 2021 Texas blackouts."

This step removes areas where reduced light may be due to decreased traffic rather than residential power outages.\n\n\n\n\nThis refinement helps ensure we’re identifying genuine residential power outages rather than changes in traffic patterns.\n\n\nQuantifying Residential Impacts\nBy intersecting the blackout areas with residential building footprints, we can estimate how many homes lost power.\n\n\nCode\n# Reproject buildings and identify those in blackout zones\nhouses &lt;- st_transform(houses, crs = 3083)\nblackout_homes &lt;- st_intersection(houses, blackout_final)\n\n# Calculate statistics\nn_blackout_homes &lt;- length(unique(blackout_homes$osm_id))\nn_total_homes &lt;- nrow(houses)\npct_impacted &lt;- round((n_blackout_homes / n_total_homes) * 100, 1)\n\n\nFinding: Approximately 157,408 residential buildings (33.1% of structures in the dataset) experienced blackouts during the February 2021 storms.\n\n\nCode\n# Create point representations for mapping\nall_homes_points &lt;- st_centroid(houses)\nnot_impacted_homes &lt;- all_homes_points[!all_homes_points$osm_id %in% blackout_homes$osm_id, ]\nimpacted_homes_points &lt;- st_centroid(blackout_homes)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntm_basemap(\"CartoDB.VoyagerNoLabels\") +\n  tm_shape(blackout_final) +\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"grey85\", col = \"grey70\", lwd = 0.3) +\n  tm_shape(not_impacted_homes) +\n  tm_dots(fill = \"#FFB3B3\", size = 0.003, fill_alpha = 0.1) +\n  tm_shape(impacted_homes_points) +\n  tm_dots(fill = \"#8B0000\", size = 0.005, fill_alpha = 0.7) +\n  tm_title(\"Residential Buildings Impacted by Blackouts\", size = 1.3) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"left\", \"top\"),\n            legend.bg.color = \"white\",\n            legend.bg.alpha = 0.85,\n            legend.text.size = 0.7,\n            legend.title.size = 0.9,\n            fontfamily = \"sans\") +\n  tm_add_legend(type = \"fill\",\n                labels = \"Blackout zone\",\n                fill = \"grey85\",\n                col = \"grey70\") +\n  tm_add_legend(type = \"symbol\",\n                labels = c(\"Power lost\", \"Power maintained\"),\n                fill = c(\"#8B0000\", \"#FFB3B3\"),\n                shape = 19,\n                size = 0.5) +\n  tm_scalebar(position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"), text.size = 0.6) +\n  tm_compass(position = c(\"right\", \"top\"), size = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial distribution of impacted and non-impacted residential buildings. Dark red points represent homes that experienced blackouts, while light pink points indicate buildings that maintained power throughout the crisis.\n\n\n\n\nThe map reveals that blackouts were widespread but not uniform. Some neighborhoods maintained power while adjacent areas went dark, suggesting the complexity of the grid failures.\n\n\nSocioeconomic Analysis: Income and Blackout Exposure\nTo investigate potential disparities in blackout impacts, I analyzed the relationship between census tract median household income and blackout exposure.\n\n\nCode\n# Transform census data to analysis CRS\nsocio &lt;- st_transform(socio, crs = 3083)\n\n# Crop to Houston area\nhouston_tracts &lt;- st_crop(socio, st_bbox(blackout_houston))\n\n# Count impacted homes per tract\nhouston_tracts$n_homes &lt;- as.numeric(lengths(st_intersects(houston_tracts, blackout_homes)))\n\n# Create impact categories for mapping\nhouston_tracts$impact_category &lt;- cut(houston_tracts$n_homes,\n                                       breaks = c(0, 1, 10, 50, 150, 500, 1500, Inf),\n                                       labels = c(\"None\",\n                                                 \"Very Low (1-10)\",\n                                                 \"Low (11-50)\",\n                                                 \"Medium (51-150)\",\n                                                 \"High (151-500)\",\n                                                 \"Very High (501-1,500)\",\n                                                 \"Extreme (&gt;1,500)\"),\n                                       include.lowest = TRUE)\n\n# Create binary blackout indicator\nhouston_tracts$blackout &lt;- factor(houston_tracts$n_homes &gt; 0,\n                                  levels = c(TRUE, FALSE),\n                                  labels = c(\"Blackout\", \"No Blackout\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntm_basemap(\"CartoDB.VoyagerNoLabels\") +\n  tm_shape(houston_tracts) +\n  tm_fill(fill = \"impact_category\",\n          fill.scale = tm_scale(values = c(\"white\", \"#feedde\", \"#fdd0a2\", \"#fdae6b\",\n                                          \"#fd8d3c\", \"#e6550d\", \"#a63603\"),\n                                value.na = \"transparent\"),\n          fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Impacted Homes\\nper Census Tract\",\n                                  title.size = 0.9,\n                                  text.size = 0.65)) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey50\", lwd = 0.3) +\n  tm_title(\"Blackout Severity by Census Tract\", size = 1.3) +\n  tm_scalebar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"), text.size = 0.6) +\n  tm_compass(position = c(\"right\", \"top\"), size = 1.5) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"top\"),\n            legend.bg.color = \"white\",\n            legend.bg.alpha = 0.85,\n            fontfamily = \"sans\")\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of residential buildings that lost power by census tract.

    "title": "Mapping the Texas Blackouts: A Spatial Analysis of the 2021 Winter Storm Impacts",
    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\n\nMain Findings\nThis spatial analysis identified approximately 157,408 residential buildings in the Houston metropolitan area that experienced power outages during the February 2021 winter storms. The widespread nature of these blackouts—affecting 33.1% of buildings in the study area—underscores the severity of the grid failure.\nContrary to patterns often observed in climate disasters, this analysis found minimal income-based disparities in blackout exposure. Both lower-income and higher-income census tracts experienced similar rates of power loss. This pattern likely reflects the unprecedented scale and systemic nature of the grid failure. When the entire electrical system was compromised by extreme cold, infrastructure vulnerabilities transcended neighborhood boundaries.\n\n\nBroader Implications\nWhile this analysis found relatively equitable blackout exposure across income levels, the impacts of those blackouts may have been highly inequitable. Research following the 2021 storms documented that low-income communities faced:\n\nGreater difficulty evacuating to heated locations\nLimited access to backup heating sources\nLonger recovery times\nHigher health impacts from cold exposure (Gronlund 2014)\n\nThis distinction between exposure and vulnerability is critical for emergency planning. Even when disasters affect communities uniformly, pre-existing inequalities shape how severely people experience those impacts.\n\n\nLimitations and Future Directions\nSeveral methodological limitations should be noted:\nTemporal resolution: This analysis compares only two snapshots in time. A more detailed temporal analysis could reveal variations in outage duration across neighborhoods, which may correlate with socioeconomic factors.\nThreshold sensitivity: The 200 nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹ threshold for defining blackouts is somewhat arbitrary. Some genuine outages may fall below this threshold, while brief flickers above it might not represent sustained power loss.\nBuilding data completeness: OpenStreetMap data coverage varies geographically. Some residential buildings may be missing from the dataset, potentially introducing bias if data quality correlates with neighborhood characteristics.\nHighway buffer distance: The 200-meter highway exclusion buffer, while reasonable, may inadvertently exclude some legitimate residential blackouts or fail to capture all traffic-related light changes.\nFuture research could enhance this analysis by:\n\nIncorporating daily VIIRS data throughout the multi-day blackout event to assess temporal patterns\nComparing blackout exposure to other socioeconomic indicators (race, age, housing tenure)\nAnalyzing recovery times and their relationship to community characteristics\nIntegrating health outcome data to assess disparate impacts beyond simple exposure\nConducting ground-truthing with utility company outage records where available\n\n\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nThis analysis supports several policy recommendations for improving grid resilience and emergency preparedness:\n\nInfrastructure hardening: The widespread nature of blackouts indicates systemic vulnerabilities that require comprehensive winterization of generation facilities and transmission infrastructure\nEmergency response planning: Even when disasters affect communities uniformly, response systems should account for differential vulnerabilities and capacities to cope with outages\nGrid interconnection: Texas’s electrical isolation limited backup power options during the crisis, suggesting value in greater regional grid connectivity\nContinued monitoring: Remote sensing approaches like this analysis can complement utility reporting to provide rapid, independent assessment of disaster impacts"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe February 2021 Texas blackouts represented a catastrophic failure of critical infrastructure affecting millions of residents. This spatial analysis demonstrates how satellite remote sensing combined with socioeconomic data can rapidly assess disaster impacts and identify affected communities. While the blackouts affected Houston relatively uniformly across income levels, likely due to the systemic nature of the grid failure, this does not mean the crisis was experienced equitably. Understanding both exposure patterns and underlying vulnerabilities remains essential for building more resilient and just infrastructure systems.\nAs climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, tools and approaches for rapid disaster assessment will become increasingly valuable for emergency response, recovery planning, and long-term adaptation."

But embedded in those findings: resource planning hadn’t kept pace with California’s changing energy mix.\nIn the 2010s, California made massive investments in solar infrastructure based on downscaled CMIP5 climate model projections. The problem? The models systematically overestimated solar generation in regions influenced by California’s coastal meteorology."

    "text": "The Marine Layer Problem\nCalifornia’s coast has a distinctive climate feature: the marine layer. Cold Pacific waters create a stable layer of cool, moist air trapped under warmer air above. That marine layer produces fog and low stratus clouds that cut incoming solar radiation by 30–50% (Iacobellis and Cayan 2013).\nThese clouds often push inland through gaps like the Golden Gate and shape microclimates, like in the redwood forests of northern California, that climate models struggle to resolve (Johnstone and Dawson 2010).\n\n\nWhat the Models See\n100-200 km grid cells\n(size of SF Bay Area)\n\nWhat Actually Matters\nMarine layer dynamics at &lt;10 km\n(Golden Gate, coastal valleys)\n\n\nGlobal Climate Models (GCMs) in CMIP5 operate at coarse resolution—typically 100-200km grid cells. Marine layer dynamics happen at much finer scales, driven by sea surface gradients, topographic channeling, diurnal cycles, and upwelling.\nEven “downscaled” versions refined to 10-20km resolution struggle to capture marine layer formation, persistence, and inland penetration.\nA 2024 CEC report (Pierce et al. 2024) states: &gt; “Coastal Low Clouds… are a persistent, seasonal feature… Accounting for these clouds improves solar energy forecasting.”\nCMIP5-era models systematically underestimated marine layer frequency, inland fog extent, and afternoon/evening cloud cover. The Result?: Solar irradiance projections that were too optimistic, especially for afternoon/evening hours—exactly when California’s “net peak” demand occurs."

    "text": "The Path From Models to Blackouts\nSo how does a bias in cloud cover modeling contribute to blackouts years later?\nThe chain looks like this:\n\n2010–2015\nCMIP5 downscaled models overestimate solar because they miss marine-layer clouds.\n2012–2018\nDevelopers invest heavily in solar based on these projections.\n2015–2020\nPlanning assumes strong late-afternoon solar output.\nActual output is lower, especially during marine-layer events.\nAugust 2020\nHistoric heat wave hits California.\nEvening demand spikes.\nSolar drops faster than expected → rolling blackouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[\"CMIP5 models&lt;br/&gt;overestimated solar\"] --&gt; B[\"Developers invested&lt;br/&gt;billions in solar\"]\n    B --&gt; C[\"Grid planning assumed&lt;br/&gt;high afternoon output\"]\n    C --&gt; D[\"Evening ramp larger&lt;br/&gt;than expected\"]\n    D --&gt; E[\"2020 heat wave&lt;br/&gt;blackouts\"]\n\n    classDef plain fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#888,color:#333\n    class A,B,C,D,E plain;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Overoptimistic generation forecasts (2010-2015) Solar developers use downscaled CMIP5 projections. Models underestimate afternoon cloud cover → projected generation 10-15% higher than reality.\nStep 2: Investment decisions (2012-2018)\nBillions flow into solar installations. Agricultural land converts to solar farms in Central Valley.\nStep 3: Grid planning (2015-2020)\nCAISO plans for solar providing increasing power, assuming generation levels matching the overoptimistic projections.\nStep 4: The “net peak” emerges\nManaging the evening “ramp” becomes critical. CAISO assumes more solar during the 5-8pm window than materializes.\nStep 5: August 2020\nHeat wave. Solar performs well mid-day but drops off earlier and faster than expected, partly due to cloud patterns the models hadn’t captured.\nCAISO’s root cause analysis (California Independent System Operator (CAISO), California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), and California Energy Commission (CEC) 2021) states: “Resource planning targets have not kept pace with the evolving power mix, wherein demand during peak hours outpaces the supply of solar-produced power.”\n\nTranslation\nWe thought we’d have more power available at this time of day than we actually do.\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters Beyond One Heat Wave\nThe marine layer bias wasn’t the primary cause of California’s blackouts—CAISO’s analysis shows it was a perfect storm. But the model bias was one link in a chain of assumptions that created vulnerability. It also shows how invisible these assumptions become once they leave the modeling world."

    "text": "Connections to EDS 242 Course Concepts\nThis case demonstrates several types of bias we studied:\nModel specification bias: systematic errors in how marine layer physics are represented in the model structure itself (Konno et al.; Lecture 2’s Catalogue of Bias).\nHistorical bias: The LOCA downscaling method assumes future relationships will match past patterns, which breaks down under climate change. (Lecture 2)\nReporting bias model limitations were documented in technical reports but didn’t get reported in the summary documents that informed billion-dollar decisions. This is what Cori Lopazanski called the “problem of too much information” in her guest lecture—scientists have caveats, but those get lost in translation to policy.(Lecture 2, Cori Lopazanski guest lecturer)\nData invisibility By 2020, the connection back to 2015 cloud modeling choices was completely invisible to everyone affected. As we learned in Lecture 9, these are “known unknowns” that become “unknown unknowns” as they propagate through decision systems. (Lecture 1, Barrowman reading)\nThe bias propagates through what Olteanu et al. call “decision chains,” compounding at each step. This connects to Environmental Data Justice themes from Lecture 8—who gets hurt when data systems fail? Not the modelers or grid planners, but families who lost groceries, elderly folks without AC, people on medical equipment."

Understanding different types of bias is crucial for interpreting these limitations (Konno et al. 2024).\n\nThe ProblemDownscalingBias CorrectionBroader Pattern\n\n\nMarine layer physics operates at scales GCMs can’t resolve. Coastal fog and low stratus depend on boundary layer processes, cloud microphysics, and topographic features at sub-grid scales (Klein et al. 2017).\n\n\nStatistical downscaling (LOCA): Uses historical relationships but assumes future will match past patterns—questionable under climate change (Ekström, Grose, and Whetton 2015).\nDynamical downscaling (WRF): Simulates physics at finer scale but inherits GCM biases.\nCalifornia’s approach (LOCA2): Combines both methods (Pierce et al. 2024). A 2024 technical report notes improvements but still recommends changing planning assumptions to account for limitations.\n\n\nDifferent bias correction methods can change answers significantly (Maraun 2016). The choice of method can shift your projection as much as the climate signal itself (Ekström, Grose, and Whetton 2015).\nCommon approaches: quantile mapping (assumes stationary bias), delta methods (assumes correct trends), deep learning (overfitting risk), and ensemble averaging (masks uncertainties).\n\n\nThis pattern shows up across environmental data science—flood risk, crop yields, hydropower, fire risk. Model biases propagate through decision chains (Olteanu et al. 2019). The projections look authoritative, but limitations don’t make it into summary documents as often as needed."

Create Feedback Loops\nCompare actual vs. projected generation. Feed learning back into models and planning. California is doing this now, but earlier detection would have helped.\n\n\n4. Invest in the Unglamorous Work\nBias correction and regional model improvement don’t make headlines, but we under-invest badly. Need better observations, higher resolution models, long-term monitoring, transparent documentation of biases.\n\n\n5. Train Decision-Makers\nEngineers, planners, policy-makers need to understand what models can and can’t tell them. A projection isn’t a prediction. Uncertainty is information. Limitations should be upfront, not buried in appendices."

    "text": "Why I Think About This\nFor my family, the 2020 blackouts were uncomfortable but manageable. For others—people dependent on medical equipment, elderly folks without AC—the stakes were higher.\nCalifornia’s grid planning documents still show tight supply margins during evening peaks. The marine layer isn’t going anywhere, though research suggests California coastal fog has declined 33% since 1950 (Johnstone and Dawson 2010), with uncertain causes and future trajectory (Torregrosa, O’Brien, and Faloona 2014).\nWhat stays with me is how easily biases slip through. Smart people, rigorous methods, peer-reviewed projections, and still, systematic errors propagate until systems fail under stress.\nI see this pattern everywhere in environmental data science. Models of crop yields, water availability, species distributions, fire risk—all rest on climate projections with known limitations. Those limitations exist, they’re documented in technical reports, but they don’t always make it into decision documents.\nWe can build better decision processes, ones that explicitly account for uncertainty, validate projections against reality, and adapt when mismatches appear. That starts with recognizing that environmental data always carries the fingerprints of choices and assumptions baked into its creation (Walker et al. 2018).\nThe point isn’t to chase perfect models. It’s to build systems that don’t fall apart when the models miss something."

To do spatial analysis with this data we must extract this data and write it to the dataset.\n\n# Use rio.crs to print CRS information\nprint(landsat.rio.crs)\n\nNone\n\n\nThis object is not currently geospatially referenced.\n\n# Print the crs by accessing spatial_ref.crs_wkt\nprint(landsat.spatial_ref.crs_wkt)\n\n# Recover the geospatial information by using rio.write_crs and the spatial reference information from b\nlandsat = landsat.rio.write_crs(landsat.spatial_ref.crs_wkt)\n\n# Print the CRS of the updated dataset\nprint(landsat.rio.crs)\n\nPROJCS[\"WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N\",GEOGCS[\"WGS 84\",DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7030\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6326\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4326\"]],PROJECTION[\"Transverse_Mercator\"],PARAMETER[\"latitude_of_origin\",0],PARAMETER[\"central_meridian\",-117],PARAMETER[\"scale_factor\",0.9996],PARAMETER[\"false_easting\",500000],PARAMETER[\"false_northing\",0],UNIT[\"metre\",1,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9001\"]],AXIS[\"Easting\",EAST],AXIS[\"Northing\",NORTH],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"32611\"]]\nEPSG:32611\n\n\n\n\n5) True color image\nA true color image displays the red, green, and blue bands as they would appear to the human eye. Often raw satellite contains extreme values that can make the rest of the image look washed out when plotting. This can be corrected by handling outliers and missing values properly as demonstrated below\n\n# Plot the true color image\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow()\nplt.show()\n\nClipping input data to the valid range for imshow with RGB data ([0..1] for floats or [0..255] for integers).\nc:\\Users\\ermil\\.conda\\envs\\eds220-env\\Lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\cm.py:478: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast\n  xx = (xx * 255).astype(np.uint8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Identify which bands have nan values using numpy.isnan() and utilize the robust parameter in the plot function\nnan_bands = []\nfor band in ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'nir08', 'swir22']:\n    if np.isnan(landsat[band]).any():\n        nan_bands.append(band)\n\nprint(\"Bands with NaN values:\", nan_bands)\n\n# use .fillna() to substitute any nan values for 0\nlandsat = landsat.fillna(0)\n\n# Re-plot the true color image\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\nplt.show()\n\nBands with NaN values: ['green', 'blue']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of outputs:\nPart (a) produced a blank-looking image along with two warnings: one about clipping RGB data to valid ranges and another about invalid values during type conversion. This is the result of extreme outliers produced by cloud reflectance that compress all other pixel values near zero when matplotlib scales the image. Part (e) produces a clear, detailed true color image with no warnings. The improvement is the result of two changes: (1) using robust=True clips extreme outlier values for better visualization, and (2) filling NaN values with zero using .fillna(0) eliminates the invalid value warning.\n\n\n6) False color image\n\n# Create a map showing the shortwave infrared/near-infrared/red false color image\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7) Map\n\n# Print CRS information for all datasets\nprint(f\"Landsat CRS: {landsat.rio.crs}\")\nprint(f\"Eaton CRS: {eaton.crs}\")\nprint(f\"Palisades CRS: {palisades.crs}\")\n\n# Reproject fire perimeters to match Landsat CRS\neaton = eaton.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\npalisades = palisades.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\n\n# Create a map showing the shortwave infrared/near-infrared/red false color image together with both fire perimeters. Customize it appropriately including, at least, an informative title and legend. You may also want to include text on the map to identify which fire is which.\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(ax=ax, robust=True)\neaton.boundary.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='yellow', label='Eaton Fire Perimeter')\npalisades.boundary.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='red', label='Palisades Fire Perimeter')\nplt.title('Landsat 8 False Color Image with Fire Perimeters')\nplt.legend()\nax.set_ylabel('Y Coordinate (meters)')\nax.set_xlabel('X Coordinate (meters)')\nax.text(eaton.geometry.centroid.x.values[0], eaton.geometry.centroid.y.values[0] - 2700, 'Eaton Fire', color='black', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')\nax.text(palisades.geometry.centroid.x.values[0] - 22000, palisades.geometry.centroid.y.values[0] + 8000, 'Palisades Fire', color='black', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')\n\nLandsat CRS: EPSG:32611\nEaton CRS: EPSG:3857\nPalisades CRS: EPSG:3857\n\n\nText(337685.36156204826, 3774541.91755668, 'Palisades Fire')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Description:\nThis map displays a false color composite image of the Eaton and Palisades fire areas captured by Landsat 8. The image uses shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to highlight burn scars and vegetation health. Healthy vegetation appears bright green due to high NIR reflectance, while burned areas appear redish brown. The fire perimeters are overlaid in yellow (Eaton Fire) and red (Palisades Fire) to highlight the extent of both fires. This false color combination is helpful for assessing fire severity and landscape recovery."

With thousands of datasets, it’s difficult to identify systemic curation issues such as missing ORCIDs or inconsistent units. This project transforms individual metadata quality assessments into standardized, scalable, and actionable insights.\nKey Deliverables:\n\nRepeatable ingest pipeline - Clean, timestamped snapshots of quality assessment data enriched with dataset metadata, with validation to catch data format changes early\nAutomated visualizations and analysis - Generate FAIR pillar summaries, temporal trends, and first vs. latest comparisons that auto-update when new data arrives\nFocused deep-dives - Analyze specific dataset types or disciplines, regroup individual checks into themes, and track percent-pass and patterns across time\nLightweight access interface - Simple filterable web interface to view and download tables, figures, and summaries by time, metadata standard, pillar, or dataset type\nStretch goal - Configure one additional repository with the same framework to demonstrate portability\n\nTechnical Approach: Building reproducible workflows in Python with open data formats (CSV, Parquet). Using Quarto/Jupyter for reports. Emphasis on lightweight, maintainable design that repository staff can sustain post-project.\nImpact: This project enhances Arctic research data accessibility and usability by turning existing checks into clear, repeatable quality signals. Plain-language, FAIR-aligned metrics reduce barriers for research teams, particularly those with limited institutional data support, promoting equitable participation in environmental science. The scalable framework offers a model for other repositories, improving the connected environmental data ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBroader Impacts\n\n\n\nPlain-language metrics and transparent interface aids environmental education and literacy. Cross-repository comparisons can identify patterns for new checks or standard improvements. The reproducible design fosters collaboration among repository teams and advances community standards for FAIR data."
