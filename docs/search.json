    "text": "Concluding Thoughts\nThis analysis tackled a challenging question—what drives wildlife-vehicle collisions on Danish roads?—using a statistical framework designed for the peculiarities of roadkill data: massive zero-inflation and overdispersion.\nKey Contributions:\n\nMethodological: We demonstrated how hurdle models handle dual processes (occurrence vs. intensity) in zero-inflated count data\nSubstantive: We quantified the effects of traffic, land use, and road characteristics on roadkill risk\nPolicy-relevant: We identified actionable levers for reducing wildlife mortality (traffic management, targeted fencing)\n\nThe Bigger Picture:\nWildlife-vehicle collisions represent a broader challenge at the intersection of human infrastructure and ecosystem health. As road networks expand globally, understanding these collision dynamics becomes critical for conservation. The statistical approach used here—combining geospatial data integration, causal reasoning (DAGs), and specialized count models—exemplifies modern environmental data science.\nBeyond Roadkill:\nThe hurdle model framework extends to many zero-inflated ecological phenomena: - Rare species observations in biodiversity surveys - Disease outbreak counts in epidemiology - Extreme weather event frequencies in climate science - Pollution violation counts in environmental monitoring\nWherever zeros dominate your count data and two distinct processes govern occurrence vs. intensity, consider the hurdle model."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\n\nThe 2021 Texas Winter Storm Crisis\nThe February 2021 winter storm, known as Winter Storm Uri, exposed critical vulnerabilities in Texas’s isolated power grid. Unlike other states, Texas operates its own grid (ERCOT), which is not connected to neighboring states, limiting backup power options during emergencies (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and North American Electric Reliability Corporation 2021). The unprecedented cold caused natural gas pipelines to freeze, wind turbines to ice over, and power plants to fail, creating a cascading crisis.\nWhile the blackouts affected millions of Texans, their impacts were not uniformly distributed. Previous research on climate disasters has shown that low-income communities and communities of color often experience disproportionate impacts from extreme weather events (Hsiang et al. 2017). These communities may face longer recovery times, limited access to emergency resources, and inadequate infrastructure (Cutter, Boruff, and Shirley 2003).\n\n\nRemote Sensing for Disaster Assessment\nSatellite-based night lights data provides a powerful tool for assessing power outages at scale. NASA’s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) captures daily nighttime light emissions, allowing researchers to detect changes in electrical grid function (Román et al. 2018). By comparing light intensity before and after disasters, we can identify affected areas without relying solely on utility company reports, which may be incomplete during major crises.\nThis analysis combines VIIRS night lights data with OpenStreetMap building footprints and U.S. Census socioeconomic data to map blackout impacts and explore potential environmental justice dimensions of the 2021 Texas blackouts."

Some neighborhoods maintained power while adjacent areas went dark, suggesting the complexity of the grid failures.\n\n\nSocioeconomic Analysis: Income and Blackout Exposure\nTo investigate potential disparities in blackout impacts, I analyzed the relationship between census tract median household income and blackout exposure.\n\n\nShow code\n# Transform census data to analysis CRS\nsocio &lt;- st_transform(socio, crs = 3083)\n\n# Crop to Houston area\nhouston_tracts &lt;- st_crop(socio, st_bbox(blackout_houston))\n\n# Count impacted homes per tract\nhouston_tracts$n_homes &lt;- as.numeric(lengths(st_intersects(houston_tracts, blackout_homes)))\n\n# Create impact categories for mapping\nhouston_tracts$impact_category &lt;- cut(houston_tracts$n_homes,\n                                       breaks = c(0, 1, 10, 50, 150, 500, 1500, Inf),\n                                       labels = c(\"None\",\n                                                 \"Very Low (1-10)\",\n                                                 \"Low (11-50)\",\n                                                 \"Medium (51-150)\",\n                                                 \"High (151-500)\",\n                                                 \"Very High (501-1,500)\",\n                                                 \"Extreme (&gt;1,500)\"),\n                                       include.lowest = TRUE)\n\n# Create binary blackout indicator\nhouston_tracts$blackout &lt;- factor(houston_tracts$n_homes &gt; 0,\n                                  levels = c(TRUE, FALSE),\n                                  labels = c(\"Blackout\", \"No Blackout\"))\n\n\n\n\nShow code\ntm_basemap(\"CartoDB.VoyagerNoLabels\") +\n  tm_shape(houston_tracts) +\n  tm_fill(fill = \"impact_category\",\n          fill.scale = tm_scale(values = c(\"white\", \"#feedde\", \"#fdd0a2\", \"#fdae6b\",\n                                          \"#fd8d3c\", \"#e6550d\", \"#a63603\"),\n                                value.na = \"transparent\"),\n          fill.legend = tm_legend(title = \"Impacted Homes\\nper Census Tract\",\n                                  title.size = 0.9,\n                                  text.size = 0.65)) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"grey50\", lwd = 0.3) +\n  tm_title(\"Blackout Severity by Census Tract\", size = 1.3) +\n  tm_scalebar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"), text.size = 0.6) +\n  tm_compass(position = c(\"right\", \"top\"), size = 1.5) +\n  tm_layout(legend.outside = FALSE,\n            legend.position = c(\"right\", \"top\"),\n            legend.bg.color = \"white\",\n            legend.bg.alpha = 0.85,\n            fontfamily = \"sans\")\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of residential buildings that lost power by census tract.

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\n\nMain Findings\nThis spatial analysis identified approximately 157,408 residential buildings in the Houston metropolitan area that experienced power outages during the February 2021 winter storms. The widespread nature of these blackouts—affecting 33.1% of buildings in the study area—underscores the severity of the grid failure.\nContrary to patterns often observed in climate disasters, this analysis found minimal income-based disparities in blackout exposure. Both lower-income and higher-income census tracts experienced similar rates of power loss. This pattern likely reflects the unprecedented scale and systemic nature of the grid failure. When the entire electrical system was compromised by extreme cold, infrastructure vulnerabilities transcended neighborhood boundaries.\n\n\nBroader Implications\nWhile this analysis found relatively equitable blackout exposure across income levels, the impacts of those blackouts may have been highly inequitable. Research following the 2021 storms documented that low-income communities faced:\n\nGreater difficulty evacuating to heated locations\nLimited access to backup heating sources\nLonger recovery times\nHigher health impacts from cold exposure (Gronlund 2014)\n\nThis distinction between exposure and vulnerability is critical for emergency planning. Even when disasters affect communities uniformly, pre-existing inequalities shape how severely people experience those impacts.\n\n\nLimitations and Future Directions\nSeveral methodological limitations should be noted:\nTemporal resolution: This analysis compares only two snapshots in time. A more detailed temporal analysis could reveal variations in outage duration across neighborhoods, which may correlate with socioeconomic factors.\nThreshold sensitivity: The 200 nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹ threshold for defining blackouts is somewhat arbitrary. Some genuine outages may fall below this threshold, while brief flickers above it might not represent sustained power loss.\nBuilding data completeness: OpenStreetMap data coverage varies geographically. Some residential buildings may be missing from the dataset, potentially introducing bias if data quality correlates with neighborhood characteristics.\nHighway buffer distance: The 200-meter highway exclusion buffer, while reasonable, may inadvertently exclude some legitimate residential blackouts or fail to capture all traffic-related light changes.\nFuture research could enhance this analysis by:\n\nIncorporating daily VIIRS data throughout the multi-day blackout event to assess temporal patterns\nComparing blackout exposure to other socioeconomic indicators (race, age, housing tenure)\nAnalyzing recovery times and their relationship to community characteristics\nIntegrating health outcome data to assess disparate impacts beyond simple exposure\nConducting ground-truthing with utility company outage records where available\n\n\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nThis analysis supports several policy recommendations for improving grid resilience and emergency preparedness:\n\nInfrastructure hardening: The widespread nature of blackouts indicates systemic vulnerabilities that require comprehensive winterization of generation facilities and transmission infrastructure\nEmergency response planning: Even when disasters affect communities uniformly, response systems should account for differential vulnerabilities and capacities to cope with outages\nGrid interconnection: Texas’s electrical isolation limited backup power options during the crisis, suggesting value in greater regional grid connectivity\nContinued monitoring: Remote sensing approaches like this analysis can complement utility reporting to provide rapid, independent assessment of disaster impacts"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe February 2021 Texas blackouts represented a catastrophic failure of critical infrastructure affecting millions of residents. This spatial analysis demonstrates how satellite remote sensing combined with socioeconomic data can rapidly assess disaster impacts and identify affected communities. While the blackouts affected Houston relatively uniformly across income levels—likely due to the systemic nature of the grid failure—this does not mean the crisis was experienced equitably. Understanding both exposure patterns and underlying vulnerabilities remains essential for building more resilient and just infrastructure systems.\nAs climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, tools and approaches for rapid disaster assessment will become increasingly valuable for emergency response, recovery planning, and long-term adaptation."
