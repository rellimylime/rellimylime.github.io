    "text": "📚 Recent Posts\n\nTeaching Computers to See What We’ve Been Ignoring\nDecember 15, 2024 • Environmental Data Science\nThere’s something magical about watching a computer learn to recognize patterns in satellite imagery that human eyes have been overlooking for decades. In my latest research on irrigation patterns in Sub-Saharan Africa, I’ve been training machine learning models to identify small-scale farming practices that traditional remote sensing has missed…\nThe challenge isn’t just technical — it’s about teaching algorithms to see with both precision and compassion. How do we ensure that our models don’t just identify patterns, but understand the human stories behind them?\nKey takeaway: The most powerful data science happens when we combine technical rigor with human empathy. Every pixel represents a real farmer, a real family, a real story of resilience and adaptation.\n\n💡 Technical note: Using a combination of Sentinel-2 imagery and custom CNN architectures, we’re achieving 94% accuracy in identifying small-scale irrigation systems. The key was training on hand-labeled data from local farmers who know their land better than any algorithm ever could.\n\n\n\n\nWhy My Dog’s Kelp Obsession Taught Me About Data Visualization\nDecember 8, 2024 • Creative Data Science\nMy dog has an unhealthy obsession with kelp. She’ll eat it fresh from the ocean, dried from the beach, or even (much to my embarrassment) straight from other people’s seaweed snacks. At first, I thought this was just another quirky dog behavior. Then I realized it was teaching me something profound about data storytelling…\nLike my dog with kelp, people are drawn to data that feels natural and authentic. The best visualizations aren’t just accurate — they’re compelling. They tell a story that makes people want to dig deeper, to understand more, to care about the implications.\nThe kelp lesson: Sometimes the most effective way to communicate complex data is to find the human (or canine) connection that makes it relatable and memorable.\n\n\n\nFrom Beach Cleanup to Policy Change: How Data Becomes Action\nNovember 30, 2024 • Environmental Activism\nLast month, I organized a beach cleanup in Isla Vista that brought together 50+ volunteers. We collected over 200 pounds of trash and microplastics. But the real impact wasn’t just in the numbers — it was in the conversations, the community connections, and the way data became a catalyst for change…\nBy documenting the types and sources of pollution we found, we created a dataset that local environmental groups are now using to advocate for policy changes. Our “random” beach cleanup became part of a larger movement toward ocean conservation.\nThe bigger picture: Every piece of data we collect, every pattern we identify, every story we tell has the potential to create real-world impact. The question isn’t whether data can change the world — it’s whether we’re brave enough to use it that way.\n\n\n\nThe Art of Scientific Communication: Why Pretty Pictures Matter\nNovember 22, 2024 • Science Communication\nI spent three hours yesterday making a single data visualization. Three hours for one chart. My advisor would probably say I’m being inefficient, but I think those three hours were the most important part of my research process…\nBeautiful, clear visualizations don’t just make data more accessible — they make it more credible. When people can see and understand your findings at a glance, they’re more likely to trust your conclusions and act on your recommendations.\nThe visualization principle: If you can’t explain your research in a single, compelling image, you probably don’t understand it well enough yet. The process of creating that perfect visualization forces you to clarify your thinking and identify the most important insights.\n\n\n\nConfessions of a Math Major Turned Environmental Scientist\nNovember 15, 2024 • Personal Journey\nI started college as a pure math major, convinced that numbers and equations were the only things that made sense in an otherwise chaotic world. Then I discovered that math could be applied to real problems — like tracking deforestation, predicting climate patterns, and understanding how humans interact with the environment…\nThe transition wasn’t always smooth. There were moments when I missed the clean elegance of pure mathematics, when real-world data felt messy and imperfect. But I learned that the messiness is where the magic happens — where mathematical rigor meets human complexity.\nMy advice to fellow math majors: Don’t be afraid to apply your skills to problems that matter. The world needs more mathematicians who are willing to get their hands dirty with real data and real-world challenges."

I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have a service dog, which has changed my life in ways I’m still understanding.\nI grew up between Concord, Massachusetts and the Central Valley of California, but my heart belongs to Great Diamond Island off the coast of Portland, Maine. There’s something about that place. I sang jazz for 11 years and spent significant time in mental hospitals—both things I think more people should be honest about. I’m very dyslexic and ADHD, which means my brain works sideways. I don’t see it as a bug; I see it as the reason I can see patterns other people miss.\nI don’t have a therapist.

    "text": "Research Focus\nMy current research sits at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, and water resource sustainability. I’m working with the Water Vegetation and Society (WaVeS) Lab at UCSB on understanding irrigation patterns in Sub-Saharan Africa using satellite data analysis. I’m particularly interested in how cutting-edge technology can illuminate patterns that affect environmental and agricultural systems, and how this data can support better decision-making for communities and ecosystems.\n\nBiomimicry\nLearning from nature is central to both my scientific outlook and personal worldview. I believe that true solutions come from respecting and integrating with the natural systems all around us. Biomimicry, to me, is about seeking guidance from nature’s intelligence—studying the processes and resilience of living systems, and exploring how these principles can inspire our own designs, behaviors, and mindsets. I strive to align my research and daily life with these lessons, drawing inspiration from the practices and wisdom of indigenous communities who have always lived in harmony with their environments. Biomimicry isn’t just an innovation strategy; it’s a path to personal, mental, and spiritual well-being by reconnecting with the natural world."

My research prioritizes supporting communities that are often overlooked by traditional environmental monitoring.\n\n\nCommunity-Centered\nThe best research happens in partnership with the communities it’s meant to serve. I prioritize collaborative approaches that respect local knowledge and ensure community benefit.\n\n\nCreative Innovation\nSome of the best solutions come from unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. Whether I’m analyzing satellite data or painting, I bring the same habit of noticing patterns and asking “what if?” I believe that technical rigor and creative thinking amplify each other—science needs imagination, and art needs precision. The breakthrough ideas happen at the intersection.\n\n\nTransparent Science\nScience should be open, reproducible, and accessible. I’m committed to transparent research practices and clear communication of complex concepts."

I’m pursuing opportunities where I can combine cutting-edge technology with real environmental and social impact. Some of the questions that keep me awake at night:\n\nHow can satellite imagery document environmental harm and support indigenous land rights? Using remote sensing as evidence for climate impacts, illegal activities, and the benefits of indigenous management practices.\nWhat does wildlife need to thrive? Analyzing wildlife corridors, the impact of infrastructure, and using animal behavior to inform conservation design.\nHow can we make environmental data work harder for people who need it? Building live, accessible data systems—not outdated snapshots—that help water managers, farmers, and communities make better decisions.\nWhat can nature teach us? Biomimicry isn’t just buzzword—it’s about genuinely learning from millions of years of evolutionary solutions: sustainable adhesion from mussels, effective ventilation from termites, wind turbines inspired by humpback whale fins.\nHow does our disconnection from nature affect our mental and emotional health? Exploring the links between environmental deprivation and well-being, and designing solutions that reconnect people to the natural world.\n\nI’m looking for roles that let me keep learning, try new things, stay near the ocean, and tackle problems that matter. Whether that’s working with NGOs, research institutions, government agencies, or social enterprises, I’m drawn to teams doing work that feels urgent and true."

The image uses shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to highlight burn scars and vegetation health. Healthy vegetation appears bright green due to high NIR reflectance, while burned areas appear redish brown. The fire perimeters are overlaid in yellow (Eaton Fire) and red (Palisades Fire) to highlight the extent of both fires. This false color combination is helpful for assessing fire severity and landscape recovery."

Healthy vegetation appears bright green due to high NIR reflectance, while burned areas appear redish brown. The fire perimeters are overlaid in yellow (Eaton Fire) and red (Palisades Fire) to highlight the extent of both fires. This false color combination is helpful for assessing fire severity and landscape recovery."

With thousands of datasets, it’s difficult to identify systemic curation issues such as missing ORCIDs or inconsistent units. This project transforms individual metadata quality assessments into standardized, scalable, and actionable insights.\nKey Deliverables:\n\nRepeatable ingest pipeline - Clean, timestamped snapshots of quality assessment data enriched with dataset metadata, with validation to catch data format changes early\nAutomated visualizations and analysis - Generate FAIR pillar summaries, temporal trends, and first vs. latest comparisons that auto-update when new data arrives\nFocused deep-dives - Analyze specific dataset types or disciplines, regroup individual checks into themes, and track percent-pass and patterns across time\nLightweight access interface - Simple filterable web interface to view and download tables, figures, and summaries by time, metadata standard, pillar, or dataset type\nStretch goal - Configure one additional repository with the same framework to demonstrate portability\n\nTechnical Approach: Building reproducible workflows in Python with open data formats (CSV, Parquet). Using Quarto/Jupyter for reports. Emphasis on lightweight, maintainable design that repository staff can sustain post-project.\nImpact: This project enhances Arctic research data accessibility and usability by turning existing checks into clear, repeatable quality signals. Plain-language, FAIR-aligned metrics reduce barriers for research teams, particularly those with limited institutional data support, promoting equitable participation in environmental science. The scalable framework offers a model for other repositories, improving the connected environmental data ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBroader Impacts\n\n\n\nPlain-language metrics and transparent interface aids environmental education and literacy. Cross-repository comparisons can identify patterns for new checks or standard improvements. The reproducible design fosters collaboration among repository teams and advances community standards for FAIR data."
