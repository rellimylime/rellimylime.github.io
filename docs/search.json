I believe that true solutions come from respecting and integrating with the natural systems all around us. Biomimicry, to me, is about seeking guidance from nature’s intelligence—studying the processes and resilience of living systems, and exploring how these principles can inspire our own designs, behaviors, and mindsets. I strive to align my research and daily life with these lessons, drawing inspiration from the practices and wisdom of indigenous communities who have always lived in harmony with their environments. Biomimicry isn’t just an innovation strategy; it’s a path to personal, mental, and spiritual well-being by reconnecting with the natural world."

I’m pursuing opportunities where I can combine cutting-edge technology with real environmental and social impact. Some of the questions that keep me awake at night:\n\nHow can satellite imagery document environmental harm and support indigenous land rights? Using remote sensing as evidence for climate impacts, illegal activities, and the benefits of indigenous management practices.\nWhat does wildlife need to thrive? Analyzing wildlife corridors, the impact of infrastructure, and using animal behavior to inform conservation design.\nHow can we make environmental data work harder for people who need it? Building live, accessible data systems—not outdated snapshots—that help water managers, farmers, and communities make better decisions.\nWhat can nature teach us? Biomimicry isn’t just buzzword—it’s about genuinely learning from millions of years of evolutionary solutions: sustainable adhesion from mussels, effective ventilation from termites, wind turbines inspired by humpback whale fins.\nHow does our disconnection from nature affect our mental and emotional health? Exploring the links between environmental deprivation and well-being, and designing solutions that reconnect people to the natural world.\n\nI’m looking for roles that let me keep learning, try new things, stay near the ocean, and tackle problems that matter.

We begin by loading the data and doing a simple exploration of its contents.\n\n# Load fire perimeter shapefiles\neaton = gpd.read_file('data/Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.shp')\npalisades = gpd.read_file('data/Palisades_Perimeter_20250121.shp')\n\n\n\nCode\n# Explore the data structure\nprint(\"Eaton Fire Perimeter:\")\nprint(eaton.info())\nprint(\"\\nPalisades Fire Perimeter:\")\nprint(palisades.info())\n\n\nEaton Fire Perimeter:\n&lt;class 'geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 20 entries, 0 to 19\nData columns (total 5 columns):\n #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype   \n---  ------      --------------  -----   \n 0   OBJECTID    20 non-null     int64   \n 1   type        20 non-null     object  \n 2   Shape__Are  20 non-null     float64 \n 3   Shape__Len  20 non-null     float64 \n 4   geometry    20 non-null     geometry\ndtypes: float64(2), geometry(1), int64(1), object(1)\nmemory usage: 932.0+ bytes\nNone\n\nPalisades Fire Perimeter:\n&lt;class 'geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 21 entries, 0 to 20\nData columns (total 5 columns):\n #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype   \n---  ------      --------------  -----   \n 0   OBJECTID    21 non-null     int64   \n 1   type        21 non-null     object  \n 2   Shape__Are  21 non-null     float64 \n 3   Shape__Len  21 non-null     float64 \n 4   geometry    21 non-null     geometry\ndtypes: float64(2), geometry(1), int64(1), object(1)\nmemory usage: 972.0+ bytes\nNone\n\n\n\nCoordinate Reference System Check\n\n\nCode\n# Check CRS\nprint(f\"Eaton CRS: {eaton.crs}\")\nprint(f\"Palisades CRS: {palisades.crs}\")\n\n\nEaton CRS: EPSG:3857\nPalisades CRS: EPSG:3857\n\n\nSummary of fire perimeter exploration:\nBoth the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeter datasets use EPSG:3857. The Eaton perimeter contains 20 polygon features while the Palisades perimeter has 21. Both Datasets share the same 5-column structure: OBJECTID, type, Shape_Are, Shape_Len, and geometry. Both of these will need to be reprojected to the crs of the raster before analysis.\n\n\n\nLoading and Processing Landsat Imagery\nThe Landsat 8 scene contains multiple spectral bands that capture different wavelengths of reflected light. Each band provides unique information about surface features. Once again we load the data and do a simple exploration.\n\n# Import Landsat data\nlandsat = xr.open_dataset('data/landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc')\n\n# Display dataset information\nlandsat\n\n\n\nCode\n# Explore dimensions and coordinates\nprint(\"Dimensions:\", landsat.dims)\nprint(\"\\nCoordinates:\", list(landsat.coords))\nprint(\"\\nData variables:\", list(landsat.data_vars))\n\n\nDimensions: FrozenMappingWarningOnValuesAccess({'y': 1418, 'x': 2742})\n\nCoordinates: ['y', 'x', 'time']\n\nData variables: ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'nir08', 'swir22', 'spatial_ref']\n\n\nSummary of Landsat Exploration:\nThe landsat 8 dataset is stored in NetCDF format which contains 5 spectral bands (red, green, blue, nir08, swir22) as well as a spatial_ref variables that stores crs information. The raster has dimensions of 2742 pixels (width) by 1418 pixels (height) and covers the area around both fires. The dataset includes three coordinates; x and y for position, and time as the third indicating observation date.\n\nRestoring Geospatial Information\nBefore we can perform spatial operations, we need to verify and restore the coordinate reference system (CRS) information.\n\nif (landsat.rio.crs == None):\n  print(\"This object is not currently geospatially referenced\")\nelse:\n  print(\"This object is geospatially referenced\")\n\nThis object is not currently geospatially referenced\n\n\n\n# Recover the geospatial information from spatial_ref\nlandsat = landsat.rio.write_crs(landsat.spatial_ref.crs_wkt)\n\nThe dataset’s CRS is restored from the spatial_ref metadata variable, setting it to EPSG:32611 (WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N), which is appropriate for the Los Angeles area.\n\n\nHandling Missing Values\n\n# Identify which bands have NaN values\nnan_bands = []\nfor band in ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'nir08', 'swir22']:\n    if np.isnan(landsat[band]).any():\n        nan_bands.append(band)\n\n# Fill NaN values with 0\nlandsat = landsat.fillna(0)\n\n\n\nBands with NaN values: ['green', 'blue']\n\n\nAll five spectral bands contain some NaN values. These can occur at the edges of satellite scenes or in areas with clouds. Filling them with zero prevents visualization errors.\n\n\n\nTrue Color Visualization\nA true color image displays the red, green, and blue bands as they would appear to the human eye. Often raw satellite contains extreme values that can make the rest of the image look washed out when plotting.\n\n# Plot the true color image\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nTrue color composite (RGB) of the fire-affected area before handling nan and 0s\n\n\n\n\nThis can be corrected by handling outliers and missing values properly\n\n\nCode\n# Identify which bands have nan values using numpy.isnan() and utilize the robust parameter in the plot function\nnan_bands = []\nfor band in ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'nir08', 'swir22']:\n    if np.isnan(landsat[band]).any():\n        nan_bands.append(band)\n\nprint(\"Bands with NaN values:\", nan_bands)\n\n# use .fillna() to substitute any nan values for 0\nlandsat = landsat.fillna(0)\n\n\nBands with NaN values: []\n\n\n\n# Create true color composite with robust scaling\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True)\nplt.title('True Color Image - Landsat 8')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nTrue color composite (RGB) of the fire-affected area\n\n\n\n\nComparison of outputs:\nPart (a) produced a blank-looking image along with two warnings: one about clipping RGB data to valid ranges and another about invalid values during type conversion. This is the result of extreme outliers produced by cloud reflectance that compress all other pixel values near zero when matplotlib scales the image. Part (e) produces a clear, detailed true color image with no warnings. The improvement is the result of two changes: (1) using robust=True clips extreme outlier values for better visualization, and (2) filling NaN values with zero using .fillna(0) eliminates the invalid value warning.\n\n\nFalse Color Analysis\nFalse color composites use non-visible wavelengths to reveal features invisible to the human eye. By assigning shortwave infrared (SWIR) to red, near-infrared (NIR) to green, and red to blue, we create an image where healthy vegetation appears bright green and burned areas show distinct reddish-brown tones.\n\n# Create false color composite (SWIR/NIR/Red)\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True)\nplt.title('False Color Composite (SWIR/NIR/Red)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFalse color composite (SWIR/NIR/Red) highlighting burn scars\n\n\n\n\nWhy this band combination?\n\nHealthy vegetation has high NIR reflectance and low SWIR reflectance → appears bright green\nBurned areas have low NIR reflectance and moderate SWIR reflectance → appears reddish-brown\nUrban areas show moderate reflectance across bands → appears in neutral tones\n\n\n\nCreating the Final Map\nTo provide geographic context, we overlay the fire perimeters onto our false color image. This requires reprojecting the vector data to match the raster’s coordinate system (EPSG:32611 - UTM Zone 11N).\n\n# Reproject fire perimeters to match Landsat CRS\neaton = eaton.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\npalisades = palisades.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\n\n# Create comprehensive map\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 12))\n\n# Plot false color composite\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(\n    ax=ax,\n    robust=True,\n    add_colorbar=False\n)\n\n# Overlay fire perimeters\neaton.boundary.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='yellow', linewidth=2, label='Eaton Fire')\npalisades.boundary.plot(ax=ax, edgecolor='red', linewidth=2, label='Palisades Fire')\n\n# Add labels and formatting\nplt.title('Eaton and Palisades Fires - False Color Analysis',\n          fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', pad=20)\nplt.legend(loc='upper right', fontsize=12)\nax.set_xlabel('Easting (meters)', fontsize=12)\nax.set_ylabel('Northing (meters)', fontsize=12)\n\n# Add fire name annotations\nax.text(eaton.geometry.centroid.x.values[0],\n        eaton.geometry.centroid.y.values[0] - 2700,\n        'Eaton Fire',\n        color='black', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold',\n        bbox=dict(boxstyle='round', facecolor='white', alpha=0.7))\n\nax.text(palisades.geometry.centroid.x.values[0] - 22000,\n        palisades.geometry.centroid.y.values[0] + 8000,\n        'Palisades Fire',\n        color='black', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold',\n        bbox=dict(boxstyle='round', facecolor='white', alpha=0.7))\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFalse color composite with fire perimeter overlays\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure Interpretation\nThis false color composite displays the Eaton and Palisades fire areas captured by Landsat 8 on February 23, 2025. The image uses shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to highlight burn scars and vegetation health.\nKey features:\n\nBright green areas = Healthy vegetation (high NIR reflectance)\nReddish-brown areas = Burned areas and bare soil (low NIR, moderate SWIR)\nUrban/developed areas = Neutral tones (moderate reflectance across bands)\n\nThe fire perimeters are overlaid in yellow (Eaton Fire) and red (Palisades Fire) to delineate the official burn boundaries. This false color combination is particularly effective for assessing fire severity and monitoring landscape recovery, as the spectral signatures of healthy vs. burned vegetation are distinctly different in the infrared wavelengths."

    "text": "Analysis 2: Environmental Justice Dimensions\nWildfires don’t impact all communities equally. This analysis examines the socioeconomic characteristics of census tracts affected by the fires to understand the environmental justice implications.\n\nData Preparation\nThe EJI dataset contains census tract-level data for all of California with 174 columns including demographic, environmental, and health vulnerability indicators. Both the EJI data and fire perimeters use EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) coordinate reference system.\n\n\nIdentifying Affected Communities\nUsing spatial intersection, we identify which census tracts overlap with the fire perimeters, then clip them to analyze only the areas actually within the burn zones.\n\n\nAnalyzing Socioeconomic Vulnerability\nThe Environmental Justice Index includes percentile rankings for various vulnerability indicators. Here we examine EPL_POV200, which represents the percentile rank of persons living below 200% of the federal poverty level—a measure of economic vulnerability.\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 8))\n\n# Define common scale for comparison\neji_variable = 'EPL_POV200'\nvmin = min(eji_clip_palisades[eji_variable].min(),\n           eji_clip_eaton[eji_variable].min())\nvmax = max(eji_clip_palisades[eji_variable].max(),\n           eji_clip_eaton[eji_variable].max())\n\n# Palisades Fire area\neji_clip_palisades.plot(\n    column=eji_variable,\n    vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\n    cmap='YlOrRd',\n    legend=False,\n    ax=ax1,\n    edgecolor='black',\n    linewidth=0.5\n)\nax1.set_title('Low-Income Population\\nPalisades Fire Area',\n              fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')\nax1.axis('off')\n\n# Eaton Fire area\neji_clip_eaton.plot(\n    column=eji_variable,\n    vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\n    cmap='YlOrRd',\n    legend=False,\n    ax=ax2,\n    edgecolor='black',\n    linewidth=0.5\n)\nax2.set_title('Low-Income Population\\nEaton Fire Area',\n              fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')\nax2.axis('off')\n\n# Overall title\nfig.suptitle('Percentile Rank of Low-Income Population in Fire-Affected Areas\\n(Income &lt;200% Federal Poverty Level)',\n             fontsize=16, fontweight='bold', y=0.98)\n\n# Shared colorbar\nsm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(\n    cmap='YlOrRd',\n    norm=plt.Normalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)\n)\ncbar_ax = fig.add_axes([0.25, 0.15, 0.5, 0.03])\ncbar = fig.colorbar(sm, cax=cbar_ax, orientation='horizontal')\ncbar.set_label('Percentile Rank (0-100)', fontsize=12)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nSocioeconomic vulnerability comparison between fire areas\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\nThis analysis reveals important differences in socioeconomic vulnerability between the two fire areas. Higher percentile values (darker colors) indicate census tracts where a larger proportion of the population faces economic vulnerability compared to other areas in California.\nUnderstanding these patterns is crucial for:\n\nEmergency response planning - ensuring resources reach vulnerable populations\nRecovery assistance - targeting aid to communities with fewer economic resources\nLong-term resilience planning - addressing pre-existing vulnerabilities that compound disaster impacts"

The false color analysis reveals the spatial extent and severity of landscape damage, while the environmental justice analysis highlights which communities face the greatest challenges in recovery.\nAs climate change increases wildfire frequency and intensity, these integrated approaches become essential for effective disaster response and equitable recovery planning. By making both the physical and social dimensions visible, we can better support communities in building resilience against future fires."

Often raw satellite contains extreme values that can make the rest of the image look washed out when plotting. This can be corrected by handling outliers and missing values properly as demonstrated below\n\n# Plot the true color image\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow()\nplt.show()\n\nClipping input data to the valid range for imshow with RGB data ([0..1] for floats or [0..255] for integers).\nc:\\Users\\ermil\\.conda\\envs\\eds220-env\\Lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\cm.py:478: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast\n  xx = (xx * 255).astype(np.uint8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Identify which bands have nan values using numpy.isnan() and utilize the robust parameter in the plot function\nnan_bands = []\nfor band in ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'nir08', 'swir22']:\n    if np.isnan(landsat[band]).any():\n        nan_bands.append(band)\n\nprint(\"Bands with NaN values:\", nan_bands)\n\n# use .fillna() to substitute any nan values for 0\nlandsat = landsat.fillna(0)\n\n# Re-plot the true color image\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\nplt.show()\n\nBands with NaN values: ['green', 'blue']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of outputs:\nPart (a) produced a blank-looking image along with two warnings: one about clipping RGB data to valid ranges and another about invalid values during type conversion. This is the result of extreme outliers produced by cloud reflectance that compress all other pixel values near zero when matplotlib scales the image. Part (e) produces a clear, detailed true color image with no warnings. The improvement is the result of two changes: (1) using robust=True clips extreme outlier values for better visualization, and (2) filling NaN values with zero using .fillna(0) eliminates the invalid value warning.\n\n\n6) False color image\n\n# Create a map showing the shortwave infrared/near-infrared/red false color image\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7) Map\n\n# Print CRS information for all datasets\nprint(f\"Landsat CRS: {landsat.rio.crs}\")\nprint(f\"Eaton CRS: {eaton.crs}\")\nprint(f\"Palisades CRS: {palisades.crs}\")\n\n# Reproject fire perimeters to match Landsat CRS\neaton = eaton.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\npalisades = palisades.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\n\n# Create a map showing the shortwave infrared/near-infrared/red false color image together with both fire perimeters.

The image uses shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to highlight burn scars and vegetation health. Healthy vegetation appears bright green due to high NIR reflectance, while burned areas appear redish brown. The fire perimeters are overlaid in yellow (Eaton Fire) and red (Palisades Fire) to highlight the extent of both fires. This false color combination is helpful for assessing fire severity and landscape recovery."

With thousands of datasets, it’s difficult to identify systemic curation issues such as missing ORCIDs or inconsistent units. This project transforms individual metadata quality assessments into standardized, scalable, and actionable insights.\nKey Deliverables:\n\nRepeatable ingest pipeline - Clean, timestamped snapshots of quality assessment data enriched with dataset metadata, with validation to catch data format changes early\nAutomated visualizations and analysis - Generate FAIR pillar summaries, temporal trends, and first vs. latest comparisons that auto-update when new data arrives\nFocused deep-dives - Analyze specific dataset types or disciplines, regroup individual checks into themes, and track percent-pass and patterns across time\nLightweight access interface - Simple filterable web interface to view and download tables, figures, and summaries by time, metadata standard, pillar, or dataset type\nStretch goal - Configure one additional repository with the same framework to demonstrate portability\n\nTechnical Approach: Building reproducible workflows in Python with open data formats (CSV, Parquet). Using Quarto/Jupyter for reports. Emphasis on lightweight, maintainable design that repository staff can sustain post-project.\nImpact: This project enhances Arctic research data accessibility and usability by turning existing checks into clear, repeatable quality signals. Plain-language, FAIR-aligned metrics reduce barriers for research teams, particularly those with limited institutional data support, promoting equitable participation in environmental science. The scalable framework offers a model for other repositories, improving the connected environmental data ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBroader Impacts\n\n\n\nPlain-language metrics and transparent interface aids environmental education and literacy. Cross-repository comparisons can identify patterns for new checks or standard improvements. The reproducible design fosters collaboration among repository teams and advances community standards for FAIR data."
