    "text": "Wildlife-vehicle collisions threaten biodiversity and pose safety risks. Understanding which road and landscape characteristics predict roadkill hotspots enables evidence-based mitigation. We analyze ~11,000 roadkill events on 241,000 Danish road segments (2017-2019) to test whether traffic volume, forest proximity, and urban development predict collision rates.\nThe puzzle: Some roads experience frequent wildlife collisions while others have zero incidents. Is it just random chance or collection bias? Or are there systematic patterns we can identify and address?\nIf we can predict which roads are most likely to become collision hotspots, transportation planners and conservationists?????? can install wildlife crossings, adjust speed limits, or ….?\n\n\nHow do traffic volume and land use characteristics affect wildlife-vehicle collisions on Danish roads?\nSpecifically, we investigate two processes:\n\nOccurrence: What makes roadkill more likely to happen at all on a given road segment?\nIntensity: Once roadkill does occur, what factors influence how many collision events happen?\n\nThe high proportion of road segments with zero observed roadkill (~83%) suggests these processes operate differently, making a hurdle model the appropriate statistical framework."

I’m working with the Water Vegetation and Society (WaVeS) Lab at UCSB on understanding irrigation patterns in Sub-Saharan Africa using satellite data analysis. I’m particularly interested in how cutting-edge technology can illuminate patterns that affect environmental and agricultural systems, and how this data can support better decision-making for communities and ecosystems.\n\nBiomimicry\nLearning from nature is central to both my scientific outlook and personal worldview. I believe that true solutions come from respecting and integrating with the natural systems all around us. Biomimicry, to me, is about seeking guidance from nature’s intelligence—studying the processes and resilience of living systems, and exploring how these principles can inspire our own designs, behaviors, and mindsets. I strive to align my research and daily life with these lessons, drawing inspiration from the practices and wisdom of indigenous communities who have always lived in harmony with their environments. Biomimicry isn’t just an innovation strategy; it’s a path to personal, mental, and spiritual well-being by reconnecting with the natural world."

I prioritize collaborative approaches that respect local knowledge and ensure community benefit.\n\n\nCreative Innovation\nSome of the best solutions come from unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated ideas. Whether I’m analyzing satellite data or painting, I bring the same habit of noticing patterns and asking “what if?” I believe that technical rigor and creative thinking amplify each other—science needs imagination, and art needs precision. The breakthrough ideas happen at the intersection.\n\n\nTransparent Science\nScience should be open, reproducible, and accessible.

I’m pursuing opportunities where I can combine cutting-edge technology with real environmental and social impact. Some of the questions that keep me awake at night:\n\nHow can satellite imagery document environmental harm and support indigenous land rights? Using remote sensing as evidence for climate impacts, illegal activities, and the benefits of indigenous management practices.\nWhat does wildlife need to thrive? Analyzing wildlife corridors, the impact of infrastructure, and using animal behavior to inform conservation design.\nHow can we make environmental data work harder for people who need it? Building live, accessible data systems—not outdated snapshots—that help water managers, farmers, and communities make better decisions.\nWhat can nature teach us? Biomimicry isn’t just buzzword—it’s about genuinely learning from millions of years of evolutionary solutions: sustainable adhesion from mussels, effective ventilation from termites, wind turbines inspired by humpback whale fins.\nHow does our disconnection from nature affect our mental and emotional health? Exploring the links between environmental deprivation and well-being, and designing solutions that reconnect people to the natural world.\n\nI’m looking for roles that let me keep learning, try new things, stay near the ocean, and tackle problems that matter. Whether that’s working with NGOs, research institutions, government agencies, or social enterprises, I’m drawn to teams doing work that feels urgent and true."

These are filled with zero to prevent visualization errors.\n\n\n\nTrue Color Visualization\nBefore creating specialized visualizations, we can verify our data by creating a true color image using the red, green, and blue bands—similar to how a standard camera would capture the scene.\n\n# Create true color composite with robust scaling\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True)\nplt.title('True Color Image - Landsat 8')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nTrue color composite (RGB) of the fire-affected area\n\n\n\n\nThe robust=True parameter clips extreme outlier values to improve visualization, preventing a few bright pixels from washing out the entire image.\n\n\nFalse Color Analysis\nFalse color composites use non-visible wavelengths to reveal features invisible to the human eye. By assigning shortwave infrared (SWIR) to red, near-infrared (NIR) to green, and red to blue, we create an image where healthy vegetation appears bright green and burned areas show distinct reddish-brown tones.\n\n# Create false color composite (SWIR/NIR/Red)\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True)\nplt.title('False Color Composite (SWIR/NIR/Red)')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFalse color composite (SWIR/NIR/Red) highlighting burn scars\n\n\n\n\nWhy this band combination?\n\nHealthy vegetation has high NIR reflectance and low SWIR reflectance → appears bright green\nBurned areas have low NIR reflectance and moderate SWIR reflectance → appears reddish-brown\nUrban areas show moderate reflectance across bands → appears in neutral tones\n\n\n\nCreating the Final Map\nTo provide geographic context, we overlay the fire perimeters onto our false color image.

The image uses shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to highlight burn scars and vegetation health.\nKey features:\n\nBright green areas = Healthy vegetation (high NIR reflectance)\nReddish-brown areas = Burned areas and bare soil (low NIR, moderate SWIR)\nUrban/developed areas = Neutral tones (moderate reflectance across bands)\n\nThe fire perimeters are overlaid in yellow (Eaton Fire) and red (Palisades Fire) to delineate the official burn boundaries. This false color combination is particularly effective for assessing fire severity and monitoring landscape recovery, as the spectral signatures of healthy vs. burned vegetation are distinctly different in the infrared wavelengths."

    "section": "Key Findings",
    "text": "Key Findings\nThis analysis reveals stark differences in socioeconomic vulnerability between the two fire areas. The maps show percentile rankings of low-income population (households earning less than 200% of the federal poverty level) within fire-affected census tracts, where higher percentile values indicate greater economic vulnerability relative to other California communities.\nPalisades Fire Area: The affected census tracts show predominantly low to moderate percentile rankings (light to medium orange colors, roughly 10th-40th percentiles). This indicates that the Palisades fire primarily impacted areas with relatively lower proportions of low-income residents compared to the state average—reflecting the area’s generally higher socioeconomic status along the Pacific coast.\nEaton Fire Area: The burn area shows significantly higher percentile rankings, with large portions in the 50th-70th percentiles (darker orange) and some tracts reaching the 80th-90th percentiles (approaching dark red). The northern portions of the Eaton fire area, particularly around Altadena, show the highest vulnerability rankings. This demonstrates that the Eaton fire disproportionately affected communities with higher concentrations of economically vulnerable residents.\nEnvironmental Justice Implications: The contrasting patterns reveal that while both fires caused extensive physical damage, the Eaton fire imposed greater socioeconomic burden on vulnerable populations who typically have fewer resources for evacuation, temporary housing, and long-term recovery. This disparity is crucial for:\n\nEmergency response planning - ensuring resources reach vulnerable populations during active disasters\nRecovery assistance - targeting aid to communities with fewer economic resources for rebuilding\nLong-term resilience planning - addressing pre-existing vulnerabilities that compound disaster impacts and hinder recovery"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis analysis demonstrates the power of integrating remote sensing techniques with environmental justice data to understand wildfire impacts through both physical and social lenses. The false color analysis using Landsat 8 imagery reveals the spatial extent and severity of burn scars across the landscape, while the environmental justice analysis uncovers critical disparities in who bears the burden of these disasters.\nThe stark contrast between the two fires—with Eaton disproportionately affecting economically vulnerable communities in the Altadena area while Palisades primarily impacted wealthier coastal neighborhoods—underscores the unequal distribution of climate disaster impacts. Communities with higher percentile rankings of low-income residents face compounded challenges: limited financial reserves for evacuation and temporary housing, reduced access to insurance, barriers to navigating recovery bureaucracy, and fewer resources for long-term rebuilding.\nThe combination of xarray, rioxarray, and geopandas provides a robust Python-based workflow for this critical multi-dataset geospatial analysis. By processing satellite imagery alongside census-based vulnerability data, we can identify not just where fires burned, but whose communities bore the burden—information essential for equitable resource allocation and recovery planning.\nAs climate change drives increased wildfire frequency and intensity across California and the Western United States, these integrated analytical approaches become indispensable tools for disaster response, recovery planning, and climate justice advocacy. Making both the physical and social dimensions of wildfire impacts visible empowers decision-makers to support vulnerable communities more effectively and challenges us to address the structural inequities that make some populations disproportionately vulnerable to environmental disasters."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\n\nThe 2021 Texas Winter Storm Crisis\nThe February 2021 winter storm, known as Winter Storm Uri, exposed critical vulnerabilities in Texas’s isolated power grid. Unlike other states, Texas operates its own grid (ERCOT), which is not connected to neighboring states, limiting backup power options during emergencies (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and North American Electric Reliability Corporation 2021). The unprecedented cold caused natural gas pipelines to freeze, wind turbines to ice over, and power plants to fail, creating a cascading crisis.\nWhile the blackouts affected millions of Texans, their impacts were not uniformly distributed. Previous research on climate disasters has shown that low-income communities and communities of color often experience disproportionate impacts from extreme weather events (Hsiang et al. 2017). These communities may face longer recovery times, limited access to emergency resources, and inadequate infrastructure (Cutter, Boruff, and Shirley 2003).\n\n\nRemote Sensing for Disaster Assessment\nSatellite-based night lights data provides a powerful tool for assessing power outages at scale. NASA’s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) captures daily nighttime light emissions, allowing researchers to detect changes in electrical grid function (Román et al. 2018). By comparing light intensity before and after disasters, we can identify affected areas without relying solely on utility company reports, which may be incomplete during major crises.\nThis analysis combines VIIRS night lights data with OpenStreetMap building footprints and U.S. Census socioeconomic data to map blackout impacts and explore potential environmental justice dimensions of the 2021 Texas blackouts."

    "title": "Mapping the Texas Blackouts: A Spatial Analysis of the 2021 Winter Storm Impacts",
    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\n\nMain Findings\nThis spatial analysis identified approximately 157,408 residential buildings in the Houston metropolitan area that experienced power outages during the February 2021 winter storms. The widespread nature of these blackouts—affecting 33.1% of buildings in the study area—underscores the severity of the grid failure.\nContrary to patterns often observed in climate disasters, this analysis found minimal income-based disparities in blackout exposure. Both lower-income and higher-income census tracts experienced similar rates of power loss. This pattern likely reflects the unprecedented scale and systemic nature of the grid failure. When the entire electrical system was compromised by extreme cold, infrastructure vulnerabilities transcended neighborhood boundaries.\n\n\nBroader Implications\nWhile this analysis found relatively equitable blackout exposure across income levels, the impacts of those blackouts may have been highly inequitable. Research following the 2021 storms documented that low-income communities faced:\n\nGreater difficulty evacuating to heated locations\nLimited access to backup heating sources\nLonger recovery times\nHigher health impacts from cold exposure (Gronlund 2014)\n\nThis distinction between exposure and vulnerability is critical for emergency planning. Even when disasters affect communities uniformly, pre-existing inequalities shape how severely people experience those impacts.\n\n\nLimitations and Future Directions\nSeveral methodological limitations should be noted:\nTemporal resolution: This analysis compares only two snapshots in time. A more detailed temporal analysis could reveal variations in outage duration across neighborhoods, which may correlate with socioeconomic factors.\nThreshold sensitivity: The 200 nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹ threshold for defining blackouts is somewhat arbitrary. Some genuine outages may fall below this threshold, while brief flickers above it might not represent sustained power loss.\nBuilding data completeness: OpenStreetMap data coverage varies geographically. Some residential buildings may be missing from the dataset, potentially introducing bias if data quality correlates with neighborhood characteristics.\nHighway buffer distance: The 200-meter highway exclusion buffer, while reasonable, may inadvertently exclude some legitimate residential blackouts or fail to capture all traffic-related light changes.\nFuture research could enhance this analysis by:\n\nIncorporating daily VIIRS data throughout the multi-day blackout event to assess temporal patterns\nComparing blackout exposure to other socioeconomic indicators (race, age, housing tenure)\nAnalyzing recovery times and their relationship to community characteristics\nIntegrating health outcome data to assess disparate impacts beyond simple exposure\nConducting ground-truthing with utility company outage records where available\n\n\n\nPolicy Recommendations\nThis analysis supports several policy recommendations for improving grid resilience and emergency preparedness:\n\nInfrastructure hardening: The widespread nature of blackouts indicates systemic vulnerabilities that require comprehensive winterization of generation facilities and transmission infrastructure\nEmergency response planning: Even when disasters affect communities uniformly, response systems should account for differential vulnerabilities and capacities to cope with outages\nGrid interconnection: Texas’s electrical isolation limited backup power options during the crisis, suggesting value in greater regional grid connectivity\nContinued monitoring: Remote sensing approaches like this analysis can complement utility reporting to provide rapid, independent assessment of disaster impacts"

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe February 2021 Texas blackouts represented a catastrophic failure of critical infrastructure affecting millions of residents. This spatial analysis demonstrates how satellite remote sensing combined with socioeconomic data can rapidly assess disaster impacts and identify affected communities. While the blackouts affected Houston relatively uniformly across income levels—likely due to the systemic nature of the grid failure—this does not mean the crisis was experienced equitably. Understanding both exposure patterns and underlying vulnerabilities remains essential for building more resilient and just infrastructure systems.\nAs climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, tools and approaches for rapid disaster assessment will become increasingly valuable for emergency response, recovery planning, and long-term adaptation."

Often raw satellite contains extreme values that can make the rest of the image look washed out when plotting. This can be corrected by handling outliers and missing values properly as demonstrated below\n\n# Plot the true color image\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow()\nplt.show()\n\nClipping input data to the valid range for imshow with RGB data ([0..1] for floats or [0..255] for integers).\nc:\\Users\\ermil\\.conda\\envs\\eds220-env\\Lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\cm.py:478: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast\n  xx = (xx * 255).astype(np.uint8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Identify which bands have nan values using numpy.isnan() and utilize the robust parameter in the plot function\nnan_bands = []\nfor band in ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'nir08', 'swir22']:\n    if np.isnan(landsat[band]).any():\n        nan_bands.append(band)\n\nprint(\"Bands with NaN values:\", nan_bands)\n\n# use .fillna() to substitute any nan values for 0\nlandsat = landsat.fillna(0)\n\n# Re-plot the true color image\nlandsat[['red', 'green', 'blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\nplt.show()\n\nBands with NaN values: ['green', 'blue']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of outputs:\nPart (a) produced a blank-looking image along with two warnings: one about clipping RGB data to valid ranges and another about invalid values during type conversion. This is the result of extreme outliers produced by cloud reflectance that compress all other pixel values near zero when matplotlib scales the image. Part (e) produces a clear, detailed true color image with no warnings. The improvement is the result of two changes: (1) using robust=True clips extreme outlier values for better visualization, and (2) filling NaN values with zero using .fillna(0) eliminates the invalid value warning.\n\n\n6) False color image\n\n# Create a map showing the shortwave infrared/near-infrared/red false color image\nlandsat[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust = True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7) Map\n\n# Print CRS information for all datasets\nprint(f\"Landsat CRS: {landsat.rio.crs}\")\nprint(f\"Eaton CRS: {eaton.crs}\")\nprint(f\"Palisades CRS: {palisades.crs}\")\n\n# Reproject fire perimeters to match Landsat CRS\neaton = eaton.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\npalisades = palisades.to_crs(landsat.rio.crs)\n\n# Create a map showing the shortwave infrared/near-infrared/red false color image together with both fire perimeters.

The image uses shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to highlight burn scars and vegetation health. Healthy vegetation appears bright green due to high NIR reflectance, while burned areas appear redish brown. The fire perimeters are overlaid in yellow (Eaton Fire) and red (Palisades Fire) to highlight the extent of both fires. This false color combination is helpful for assessing fire severity and landscape recovery."

Traditional remote sensing methods often miss small-scale agricultural practices, leading to significant underestimates of water use and agricultural productivity.\nKey Innovation: Developing statistical frameworks and Python workflows to process multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery and identify center pivot and decentralized irrigation systems. The analysis integrates satellite data with hydrological and agricultural systems modeling.\nImpact: Research findings are informing water resource management decisions and climate adaptation planning for local governments and agricultural extension services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTechnical Details\n\n\n\nProcessing Sentinel-2 (10m resolution) multi-temporal data to detect irrigation signatures across seasons. Developing Python workflows for large-scale satellite imagery analysis and spatial statistical modeling of agricultural water systems."

    "text": "Proposed & In-Progress Projects\n\nScaling Metadata Quality Assessment for Environmental Data Repositories\nClient: Arctic Data Center / National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)\nTimeline: Fall 2024 - Spring 2025\nStatus: MEDS Capstone Project\nThis capstone project builds reproducible, scalable workflows to aggregate and visualize FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) metadata quality assessments across environmental data repositories.\nProject Goal: Currently, the Arctic Data Center runs automated metadata checks generating per-dataset results, but aggregated results are not readily available. With thousands of datasets, it’s difficult to identify systemic curation issues such as missing ORCIDs or inconsistent units. This project transforms individual metadata quality assessments into standardized, scalable, and actionable insights.\nKey Deliverables:\n\nRepeatable ingest pipeline - Clean, timestamped snapshots of quality assessment data enriched with dataset metadata, with validation to catch data format changes early\nAutomated visualizations and analysis - Generate FAIR pillar summaries, temporal trends, and first vs. latest comparisons that auto-update when new data arrives\nFocused deep-dives - Analyze specific dataset types or disciplines, regroup individual checks into themes, and track percent-pass and patterns across time\nLightweight access interface - Simple filterable web interface to view and download tables, figures, and summaries by time, metadata standard, pillar, or dataset type\nStretch goal - Configure one additional repository with the same framework to demonstrate portability\n\nTechnical Approach: Building reproducible workflows in Python with open data formats (CSV, Parquet). Using Quarto/Jupyter for reports. Emphasis on lightweight, maintainable design that repository staff can sustain post-project.\nImpact: This project enhances Arctic research data accessibility and usability by turning existing checks into clear, repeatable quality signals. Plain-language, FAIR-aligned metrics reduce barriers for research teams, particularly those with limited institutional data support, promoting equitable participation in environmental science. The scalable framework offers a model for other repositories, improving the connected environmental data ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBroader Impacts\n\n\n\nPlain-language metrics and transparent interface aids environmental education and literacy. Cross-repository comparisons can identify patterns for new checks or standard improvements. The reproducible design fosters collaboration among repository teams and advances community standards for FAIR data."
