    "text": "Concluding Thoughts\nThis analysis tackled a challenging question—what drives wildlife-vehicle collisions on Danish roads?—using a statistical framework designed for the peculiarities of roadkill data: massive zero-inflation and overdispersion.\nKey Contributions:\n\nMethodological: We demonstrated how hurdle models handle dual processes (occurrence vs. intensity) in zero-inflated count data\nSubstantive: We quantified the effects of traffic, land use, and road characteristics on roadkill risk\nPolicy-relevant: We identified actionable levers for reducing wildlife mortality (traffic management, targeted fencing)\n\nThe Bigger Picture:\nWildlife-vehicle collisions represent a broader challenge at the intersection of human infrastructure and ecosystem health. As road networks expand globally, understanding these collision dynamics becomes critical for conservation. The statistical approach used here—combining geospatial data integration, causal reasoning (DAGs), and specialized count models—exemplifies modern environmental data science.\nBeyond Roadkill:\nThe hurdle model framework extends to many zero-inflated ecological phenomena: - Rare species observations in biodiversity surveys - Disease outbreak counts in epidemiology - Extreme weather event frequencies in climate science - Pollution violation counts in environmental monitoring\nWherever zeros dominate your count data and two distinct processes govern occurrence vs. intensity, consider the hurdle model."
