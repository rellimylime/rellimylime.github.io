## A Few Things About Me

I'm a MEDS student at UCSB working on remote sensing, machine learning, and data infrastructure for environmental systems. I organize community initiatives, mentor in STEM, and believe creativity and science are just different languages for the same truth.

Off the computer: I paint, photograph, write poetry, and spend way too much time thinking about satellite imagery of agricultural systems in Sub-Saharan Africa.
