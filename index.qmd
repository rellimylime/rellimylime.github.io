## Research & Work

I'm a Master of Environmental Data Science student at UCSB (graduating June 2026) developing machine learning and remote sensing approaches to understand environmental systems. Currently working on irrigation pattern mapping in Sub-Saharan Africa with the Water Vegetation and Society (WaVeS) Lab, and designing scalable metadata quality assessment tools for environmental data repositories as my capstone project.

My work combines technical rigor with creative problem-solving to tackle real-world environmental challenges—from satellite imagery analysis to building tools that make environmental data more accessible and usable.

Beyond the laboratory, I organize community environmental initiatives through IV Recovery and actively engage in mentorship through Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE).

*Equal parts quantitative rigor and unreasonable hope.*

### Current Focus

-   **Remote Sensing & Machine Learning** — Satellite imagery analysis for understanding agricultural water systems and environmental monitoring
-   **Environmental Data Infrastructure** — Building reproducible, scalable tools to improve data quality and accessibility
-   **Community Engagement** — Organizing local environmental stewardship and mentoring students in STEM fields
-   **Research Communication** — Presenting findings at conferences and through peer collaboration

## Creative Practice

Beyond the laboratory, I maintain an active creative practice encompassing visual art, photography, and poetry. I believe that creativity and scientific inquiry are complementary forces—both require careful observation, pattern recognition, and the courage to explore the unknown.

My artistic work often draws inspiration from data patterns and environmental observation, creating visual bridges between quantitative analysis and aesthetic expression.
