Currently turning pixels into policy at UCSB — teaching computers to notice what we've been ignoring. My research uses satellite imagery to track irrigation patterns and land use across Sub-Saharan Africa. I'm excited about applying machine vision and deep learning to biodiversity conservation, wildlife corridors, and indigenous land rights — turning terabytes of satellite data into something more useful than a very expensive screensaver.

Beyond the screen, I organize beach cleanups in Isla Vista and think a lot about how data becomes action, how models become movements, and whether my dog will ever stop eating kelp.

Equal parts quantitative rigor and unreasonable hope.
