## Research

Currently pursuing a PhD in Environmental Data Science at UCSB, where I develop machine learning models to analyze satellite imagery and track environmental changes across Sub-Saharan Africa. My research focuses on applying computer vision and deep learning techniques to biodiversity conservation, wildlife corridor mapping, and indigenous land rights monitoring.

Beyond the laboratory, I am actively involved in community environmental initiatives and beach cleanup organizations in Isla Vista, exploring how data-driven insights can translate into meaningful environmental action.

*Equal parts quantitative rigor and unreasonable hope.*

-   **Remote Sensing:** Machine learning for satellite imagery analysis and habitat mapping
-   **Biodiversity:** Wildlife corridors and species tracking
-   **Community Science:** Collaborations for local environmental impact
-   **Publications and Talks:** Sharing results at conferences and in journals

## Creative Practice

Beyond the laboratory, I maintain an active creative practice that encompasses visual art, photography, and poetry. I believe that creativity and scientific inquiry are complementary forces — both require careful observation, pattern recognition, and the courage to explore the unknown.

My artistic work often draws inspiration from the data patterns I encounter in my research, creating visual bridges between quantitative analysis and aesthetic expression.
