## Introduction

In February 2021, a historic winter storm swept across Texas, bringing record-low temperatures and overwhelming the state's power grid. At the peak of the crisis, more than 4.5 million homes and businesses lost power, leaving residents without electricity for heating during freezing temperatures [@busby2021]. The event resulted in at least 246 deaths and an estimated \$195 billion in economic damages, making it one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history [@noaa2021].

### Research Question

This analysis addresses a critical question: **Which communities in the Houston metropolitan area were most affected by the blackouts, and were there disparities in impacts across different income levels?**

Understanding the spatial distribution of power outages and their relationship to socioeconomic factors is essential for:

- Improving power grid resilience and emergency response planning
- Identifying vulnerable communities that may need additional support during future crises
- Informing equitable infrastructure investment decisions

## Background

### The 2021 Texas Winter Storm Crisis

The February 2021 winter storm, known as Winter Storm Uri, exposed critical vulnerabilities in Texas's isolated power grid. Unlike other states, Texas operates its own grid (ERCOT), which is not connected to neighboring states, limiting backup power options during emergencies [@nrel2021]. The unprecedented cold caused natural gas pipelines to freeze, wind turbines to ice over, and power plants to fail, creating a cascading crisis.

While the blackouts affected millions of Texans, their impacts were not uniformly distributed. Previous research on climate disasters has shown that low-income communities and communities of color often experience disproportionate impacts from extreme weather events [@hsiang2019]. These communities may face longer recovery times, limited access to emergency resources, and inadequate infrastructure [@cutter2006].

### Remote Sensing for Disaster Assessment

Satellite-based night lights data provides a powerful tool for assessing power outages at scale. NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) captures daily nighttime light emissions, allowing researchers to detect changes in electrical grid function [@roman2018]. By comparing light intensity before and after disasters, we can identify affected areas without relying solely on utility company reports, which may be incomplete during major crises.

This analysis combines VIIRS night lights data with OpenStreetMap building footprints and U.S. Census socioeconomic data to map blackout impacts and explore potential environmental justice dimensions of the 2021 Texas blackouts.

## Data and Methods

### Data Sources

This analysis integrates four primary datasets:

**VIIRS Night Lights Data** — NASA's VIIRS instrument provides daily measurements of nighttime light intensity. I used two dates of imagery: February 7, 2021 (before the storm) and February 16, 2021 (during the height of the blackouts). The data is measured in nanowatts per square centimeter per steradian (nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹) [@nasa2021].

**OpenStreetMap Building Footprints** — Residential building polygons for the Houston metropolitan area, including houses, apartments, and other residential structures [@openstreetmap2021].

**OpenStreetMap Road Network** — Highway and major road data used to filter out areas where reduced light may be due to decreased traffic rather than power outages [@openstreetmap2021].

**U.S. Census American Community Survey** — 2015-2019 five-year estimates at the census tract level, including median household income data [@census2019].

### Analytical Approach

```{r setup}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false

# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)      # Data manipulation and visualization
library(sf)             # Spatial data handling
library(here)           # File path management
library(terra)          # Raster data processing
library(stars)          # Spatiotemporal arrays
library(tmap)           # Thematic mapping
library(kableExtra)     # Table formatting
```

The analysis follows these steps:

1. **Load and prepare spatial data** — Read VIIRS night lights tiles, building footprints, road networks, and census data
2. **Calculate light intensity changes** — Compare pre- and post-storm imagery to identify areas with significant light reduction
3. **Define blackout threshold** — Classify areas with light intensity drops >200 nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹ as experiencing blackouts
4. **Filter highway corridors** — Exclude areas within 200m of major highways to avoid misidentifying reduced traffic as power outages
5. **Identify impacted buildings** — Intersect blackout areas with residential building footprints
6. **Analyze socioeconomic patterns** — Compare median household income distributions between census tracts with and without blackouts

### Loading and Preparing the Data

```{r load_data}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false

# Load VIIRS night lights raster tiles for Houston area
# February 7, 2021 (pre-storm)

VIIRS_07a <- rast(here("posts/eds223-final/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.tif"))
VIIRS_07b <- rast(here("posts/eds223-final/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.tif"))

# February 16, 2021 (during blackouts)
VIIRS_16a <- rast(here("posts/eds223-final/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.tif"))
VIIRS_16b <- rast(here("posts/eds223-final/data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.tif"))

# Load OpenStreetMap highways (motorways only)
highways <- st_read(here("posts/eds223-final/data/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg/gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg"),
                    query = "SELECT * FROM gis_osm_roads_free_1 WHERE fclass='motorway'",
                    quiet = TRUE)

# Load OpenStreetMap residential buildings
houses <- st_read(here("posts/eds223-final/data/gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg/gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg"),
                  query = "SELECT * FROM gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1
                           WHERE (type IS NULL AND name IS NULL)
                           OR type in ('residential', 'apartments', 'house', 'static_caravan', 'detached')",
                  quiet = TRUE)
```

```{r prepare_census}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false

# Load Census ACS data - requires joining geometry with income attributes
socio_geom <- st_read(here("posts/eds223-final/data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb/"),
                      layer = "ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS", quiet = TRUE)

socio_income <- st_read(here("posts/eds223-final/data/ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48_TEXAS.gdb/"),
                        layer = "X19_INCOME", quiet = TRUE)

# Join income data to geometries and reproject to match building data
socio <- socio_geom %>%
  rename("GEOID_Data" = "GEOID_Data") %>%
  left_join(socio_income %>% rename("GEOID_Data" = "GEOID"), by = "GEOID_Data") %>%
  st_transform(st_crs(houses))
```

All datasets use different coordinate reference systems initially, so I standardized them to EPSG:3083 (NAD83 / Texas Centric Albers Equal Area), which preserves area measurements needed for accurate spatial analysis.

## Results

### Visualizing the Blackouts: Before and After

The stark difference in nighttime light emissions reveals the massive scale of the power outages across Houston.

```{r before_after_prep}
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false

# Merge VIIRS tiles for each date
VIIRS_07 <- merge(VIIRS_07a, VIIRS_07b)  # Pre-storm
VIIRS_16 <- merge(VIIRS_16a, VIIRS_16b)  # During blackouts

# Define Houston bounding box
HOUSTON_BBOX <- st_bbox(c(xmin = -96.5, ymin = 29,
                          xmax = -94.5, ymax = 30.5),
                        crs = st_crs(VIIRS_07))

# Crop to Houston area
crop_07 <- crop(VIIRS_07, HOUSTON_BBOX)
crop_16 <- crop(VIIRS_16, HOUSTON_BBOX)

# Mask unrealistic values (>1000 or ≤0)
masked_07 <- crop_07
masked_07[(masked_07 > 1000) | (masked_07 <= 0)] <- NA

masked_16 <- crop_16
masked_16[(masked_16 > 1000) | (masked_16 <= 0)] <- NA

# Combine for side-by-side comparison
combined_crop <- c(masked_07, masked_16)
names(combined_crop) <- c("February 7, 2021 (Before)", "February 16, 2021 (After)")
```

```{r fig_before_after}
#| fig-cap: "Night lights imagery showing Houston before (left) and during (right) the February 2021 blackouts. Darker areas in the right panel indicate regions that lost power. The widespread darkening across the metropolitan area illustrates the extensive scale of the grid failure."
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 6
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true

tm_shape(combined_crop) +
  tm_raster(col.scale = tm_scale(values = "inferno"),
            col.legend = tm_legend(title = "Light Intensity\n(nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹)",
                                   title.size = 0.9,
                                   text.size = 0.6)) +
  tm_facets(ncol = 2, free.scales = FALSE) +
  tm_title("Houston Night Lights: Before and After the Storm", size = 1.2) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,
            legend.outside.position = "right",
            legend.outside.size = 0.12,
            panel.labels = c("February 7 (Before)", "February 16 (After)"),
            fontfamily = "sans") +
  tm_graticules(lwd = 0.2, col = "white", alpha = 0.3, labels.size = 0.5)
```

The comparison reveals significant light reduction across much of the Houston metropolitan area. The bright urban core visible on February 7 dims substantially by February 16, indicating widespread power failures.

### Identifying Blackout Areas

To systematically identify blackout zones, I calculated the difference in light intensity and classified areas with drops greater than 200 nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹ as experiencing blackouts.

```{r identify_blackouts}
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false

# Calculate light intensity difference
VIIRS_houston_diff <- VIIRS_07 - VIIRS_16

# Classify blackout areas (drops >200 as blackouts)
blackout_mask <- classify(VIIRS_houston_diff,
                         matrix(c(-Inf, 200, NA,  # Not a blackout
                                  200, Inf, 1),   # Blackout
                                ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE))

# Convert raster to vector polygons
blackout_vector <- st_as_stars(blackout_mask) %>%
  st_as_sf() %>%
  st_make_valid()

# Crop to Houston and reproject
blackout_houston <- st_crop(blackout_vector, HOUSTON_BBOX) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3083)
```

```{r fig_initial_blackouts}
#| fig-cap: "Initial identification of blackout areas based on night lights analysis. Red areas experienced light intensity drops exceeding 200 nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹, indicating likely power outages."
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 7
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true

blackout_houston_union <- st_union(blackout_houston)

tm_basemap("CartoDB.VoyagerNoLabels") +
  tm_shape(blackout_houston_union) +
  tm_polygons(fill = "#d62728",
              fill_alpha = 0.6,
              col = "#8b0000",
              lwd = 0.5) +
  tm_title("Detected Blackout Areas in Houston", size = 1.2) +
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,
            fontfamily = "sans") +
  tm_scalebar(position = c("left", "bottom"), text.size = 0.6) +
  tm_compass(position = c("right", "top"), size = 1.5)
```

### Refining the Analysis: Excluding Highways

Major highways may show reduced light intensity due to decreased traffic rather than residential power outages. To improve accuracy, I excluded areas within 200 meters of motorways.

```{r exclude_highways}
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false

# Reproject highways and create 200m buffer
highways <- st_transform(highways, crs = 3083)
highway_buffer <- highways %>%
  st_union() %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 200)

# Remove highway buffers from blackout areas
blackout_final <- st_difference(blackout_houston, highway_buffer)
```

```{r fig_highway_refinement}
#| fig-cap: "Refinement of blackout areas by excluding highway corridors. The yellow lines show major highways with 200m buffers applied. This step removes areas where reduced light may be due to decreased traffic rather than residential power outages."
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 8
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true

# Visualize the highway exclusion process
tm_basemap("CartoDB.VoyagerNoLabels") +
  tm_shape(st_union(blackout_houston)) +
  tm_polygons(fill = "#d62728",
              fill_alpha = 0.3,
              col = "#8b0000",
              lwd = 0.3) +
  tm_shape(highways) +
  tm_lines(col = "#FDB863",
           lwd = 2) +
  tm_shape(st_union(blackout_final)) +
  tm_polygons(fill = "#8b0000",
              fill_alpha = 0.6,
              col = "#4d0000",
              lwd = 0.5) +
  tm_add_legend(type = "fill",
                labels = c("Initial blackout areas", "Refined blackout areas (highways excluded)"),
                fill = c("#d62728", "#8b0000"),
                fill_alpha = c(0.3, 0.6)) +
  tm_add_legend(type = "line",
                labels = "Major highways",
                col = "#FDB863",
                lwd = 2) +
  tm_title("Highway Corridor Exclusion", size = 1.2) +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("left", "top"),
            legend.bg.color = "white",
            legend.bg.alpha = 0.85,
            legend.text.size = 0.65,
            fontfamily = "sans") +
  tm_scalebar(position = c("right", "bottom"), text.size = 0.6) +
  tm_compass(position = c("right", "top"), size = 1.5)
```

This refinement helps ensure we're identifying genuine residential power outages rather than changes in traffic patterns.

### Quantifying Residential Impacts

By intersecting the blackout areas with residential building footprints, we can estimate how many homes lost power.

```{r count_impacted}
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false

# Reproject buildings and identify those in blackout zones
houses <- st_transform(houses, crs = 3083)
blackout_homes <- st_intersection(houses, blackout_final)

# Calculate statistics
n_blackout_homes <- length(unique(blackout_homes$osm_id))
n_total_homes <- nrow(houses)
pct_impacted <- round((n_blackout_homes / n_total_homes) * 100, 1)
```

**Finding:** Approximately **`r format(n_blackout_homes, big.mark = ",")`** residential buildings (`r pct_impacted`% of structures in the dataset) experienced blackouts during the February 2021 storms.

```{r prep_home_maps}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false

# Create point representations for mapping
all_homes_points <- st_centroid(houses)
not_impacted_homes <- all_homes_points[!all_homes_points$osm_id %in% blackout_homes$osm_id, ]
impacted_homes_points <- st_centroid(blackout_homes)
```

```{r fig_impacted_homes}
#| fig-cap: "Spatial distribution of impacted and non-impacted residential buildings. Dark red points represent homes that experienced blackouts, while light pink points indicate buildings that maintained power throughout the crisis."
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 9
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true

tm_basemap("CartoDB.VoyagerNoLabels") +
  tm_shape(blackout_final) +
  tm_polygons(fill = "grey85", col = "grey70", lwd = 0.3) +
  tm_shape(not_impacted_homes) +
  tm_dots(fill = "#FFB3B3", size = 0.003, fill_alpha = 0.1) +
  tm_shape(impacted_homes_points) +
  tm_dots(fill = "#8B0000", size = 0.005, fill_alpha = 0.7) +
  tm_title("Residential Buildings Impacted by Blackouts", size = 1.3) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = FALSE,
            legend.position = c("left", "top"),
            legend.bg.color = "white",
            legend.bg.alpha = 0.85,
            legend.text.size = 0.7,
            legend.title.size = 0.9,
            fontfamily = "sans") +
  tm_add_legend(type = "fill",
                labels = "Blackout zone",
                fill = "grey85",
                col = "grey70") +
  tm_add_legend(type = "symbol",
                labels = c("Power lost", "Power maintained"),
                fill = c("#8B0000", "#FFB3B3"),
                shape = 19,
                size = 0.5) +
  tm_scalebar(position = c("right", "bottom"), text.size = 0.6) +
  tm_compass(position = c("right", "top"), size = 1.5)
```

The map reveals that blackouts were widespread but not uniform. Some neighborhoods maintained power while adjacent areas went dark, suggesting the complexity of the grid failures.

### Socioeconomic Analysis: Income and Blackout Exposure

To investigate potential disparities in blackout impacts, I analyzed the relationship between census tract median household income and blackout exposure.

```{r census_analysis}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false

# Transform census data to analysis CRS
socio <- st_transform(socio, crs = 3083)

# Crop to Houston area
houston_tracts <- st_crop(socio, st_bbox(blackout_houston))

# Count impacted homes per tract
houston_tracts$n_homes <- as.numeric(lengths(st_intersects(houston_tracts, blackout_homes)))

# Create impact categories for mapping
houston_tracts$impact_category <- cut(houston_tracts$n_homes,
                                       breaks = c(0, 1, 10, 50, 150, 500, 1500, Inf),
                                       labels = c("None",
                                                 "Very Low (1-10)",
                                                 "Low (11-50)",
                                                 "Medium (51-150)",
                                                 "High (151-500)",
                                                 "Very High (501-1,500)",
                                                 "Extreme (>1,500)"),
                                       include.lowest = TRUE)

# Create binary blackout indicator
houston_tracts$blackout <- factor(houston_tracts$n_homes > 0,
                                  levels = c(TRUE, FALSE),
                                  labels = c("Blackout", "No Blackout"))
```

```{r fig_tract_impacts}
#| fig-cap: "Number of residential buildings that lost power by census tract. Darker colors indicate higher numbers of impacted homes. The spatial pattern shows that some tracts experienced extreme impacts while neighboring areas had minimal disruption."

            legend.bg.alpha = 0.85,
            fontfamily = "sans")
```

The census tract analysis reveals substantial variation in blackout severity. Some tracts lost power for more than 1,500 residential buildings, while others experienced minimal disruption.

**Key Finding:** Census tracts that experienced blackouts had a median household income of **`r format(median(houston_tracts$B19013e1[houston_tracts$blackout == "Blackout"], na.rm = TRUE), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`**, compared to **`r format(median(houston_tracts$B19013e1[houston_tracts$blackout == "No Blackout"], na.rm = TRUE), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`** for tracts without blackouts. The difference of approximately \$3,000 represents only about 5% variation, suggesting that income level was not a strong predictor of blackout exposure in this event.

## Discussion

### Main Findings

This spatial analysis identified approximately **`r format(n_blackout_homes, big.mark = ",")`** residential buildings in the Houston metropolitan area that experienced power outages during the February 2021 winter storms. The widespread nature of these blackouts—affecting `r pct_impacted`% of buildings in the study area—underscores the severity of the grid failure.

Contrary to patterns often observed in climate disasters, this analysis found minimal income-based disparities in blackout exposure. Both lower-income and higher-income census tracts experienced similar rates of power loss. This pattern likely reflects the unprecedented scale and systemic nature of the grid failure. When the entire electrical system was compromised by extreme cold, infrastructure vulnerabilities transcended neighborhood boundaries.

### Broader Implications

While this analysis found relatively equitable blackout exposure across income levels, the *impacts* of those blackouts may have been highly inequitable. Research following the 2021 storms documented that low-income communities faced:

- Greater difficulty evacuating to heated locations
- Limited access to backup heating sources
- Longer recovery times
- Higher health impacts from cold exposure [@gronlund2022]

This distinction between exposure and vulnerability is critical for emergency planning. Even when disasters affect communities uniformly, pre-existing inequalities shape how severely people experience those impacts.

### Limitations and Future Directions

Several methodological limitations should be noted:

**Temporal resolution:** This analysis compares only two snapshots in time. A more detailed temporal analysis could reveal variations in outage duration across neighborhoods, which may correlate with socioeconomic factors.

**Threshold sensitivity:** The 200 nW cm⁻²sr⁻¹ threshold for defining blackouts is somewhat arbitrary. Some genuine outages may fall below this threshold, while brief flickers above it might not represent sustained power loss.

**Building data completeness:** OpenStreetMap data coverage varies geographically. Some residential buildings may be missing from the dataset, potentially introducing bias if data quality correlates with neighborhood characteristics.

**Highway buffer distance:** The 200-meter highway exclusion buffer, while reasonable, may inadvertently exclude some legitimate residential blackouts or fail to capture all traffic-related light changes.

Future research could enhance this analysis by:

- Incorporating daily VIIRS data throughout the multi-day blackout event to assess temporal patterns
- Comparing blackout exposure to other socioeconomic indicators (race, age, housing tenure)
- Analyzing recovery times and their relationship to community characteristics
- Integrating health outcome data to assess disparate impacts beyond simple exposure
- Conducting ground-truthing with utility company outage records where available

### Policy Recommendations

This analysis supports several policy recommendations for improving grid resilience and emergency preparedness:

1. **Infrastructure hardening:** The widespread nature of blackouts indicates systemic vulnerabilities that require comprehensive winterization of generation facilities and transmission infrastructure
2. **Emergency response planning:** Even when disasters affect communities uniformly, response systems should account for differential vulnerabilities and capacities to cope with outages
3. **Grid interconnection:** Texas's electrical isolation limited backup power options during the crisis, suggesting value in greater regional grid connectivity
4. **Continued monitoring:** Remote sensing approaches like this analysis can complement utility reporting to provide rapid, independent assessment of disaster impacts

## Conclusion

The February 2021 Texas blackouts represented a catastrophic failure of critical infrastructure affecting millions of residents. This spatial analysis demonstrates how satellite remote sensing combined with socioeconomic data can rapidly assess disaster impacts and identify affected communities. While the blackouts affected Houston relatively uniformly across income levels—likely due to the systemic nature of the grid failure—this does not mean the crisis was experienced equitably. Understanding both exposure patterns and underlying vulnerabilities remains essential for building more resilient and just infrastructure systems.

As climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, tools and approaches for rapid disaster assessment will become increasingly valuable for emergency response, recovery planning, and long-term adaptation.
