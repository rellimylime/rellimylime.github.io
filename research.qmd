## Research Philosophy

My research sits at the intersection of remote sensing, machine learning, and environmental justice. I believe that the most powerful environmental science happens when we combine technical rigor with human empathy, using cutting-edge technology to address real-world challenges faced by communities around the globe.

## Core Research Principles

-   **Community-Centered:** All research should ultimately benefit the communities whose environments we're studying
-   **Interdisciplinary:** The best solutions come from combining insights across multiple fields
-   **Reproducible:** Open science and reproducible research practices are essential for building trust
-   **Actionable:** Research should lead to tangible policy recommendations and environmental action

## Current Research Projects

### Satellite-Based Irrigation Mapping in Sub-Saharan Africa

**Collaborators:** UCSB Water Vegetation and Society (WaVeS) Lab, Prof. Kelly Caylor\
**Timeline:** June 2024 - Present\
**Status:** In Progress

This project uses high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning to identify and map irrigation patterns across Sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional remote sensing methods often miss small-scale agricultural practices, leading to significant underestimates of water use and agricultural productivity.

**Key Innovation:** Developing statistical frameworks and Python workflows to process multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery and identify center pivot and decentralized irrigation systems. The analysis integrates satellite data with hydrological and agricultural systems modeling.

**Impact:** Research findings are informing water resource management decisions and climate adaptation planning for local governments and agricultural extension services.

## Proposed & In-Progress Projects

### Scaling Metadata Quality Assessment for Environmental Data Repositories

**Client:** Arctic Data Center / National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)\
**Timeline:** Fall 2024 - Spring 2025\
**Status:** MEDS Capstone Project

This capstone project builds reproducible, scalable workflows to aggregate and visualize FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) metadata quality assessments across environmental data repositories.

**Project Goal:** Currently, the Arctic Data Center runs automated metadata checks generating per-dataset results, but aggregated results are not readily available. With thousands of datasets, it's difficult to identify systemic curation issues such as missing ORCIDs or inconsistent units. This project transforms individual metadata quality assessments into standardized, scalable, and actionable insights.

**Key Deliverables:**

1.  **Repeatable ingest pipeline** - Clean, timestamped snapshots of quality assessment data enriched with dataset metadata, with validation to catch data format changes early
2.  **Automated visualizations and analysis** - Generate FAIR pillar summaries, temporal trends, and first vs. latest comparisons that auto-update when new data arrives
3.  **Focused deep-dives** - Analyze specific dataset types or disciplines, regroup individual checks into themes, and track percent-pass and patterns across time
4.  **Lightweight access interface** - Simple filterable web interface to view and download tables, figures, and summaries by time, metadata standard, pillar, or dataset type
5.  **Stretch goal** - Configure one additional repository with the same framework to demonstrate portability

**Technical Approach:** Building reproducible workflows in Python with open data formats (CSV, Parquet). Using Quarto/Jupyter for reports. Emphasis on lightweight, maintainable design that repository staff can sustain post-project.

**Impact:** This project enhances Arctic research data accessibility and usability by turning existing checks into clear, repeatable quality signals. Plain-language, FAIR-aligned metrics reduce barriers for research teams, particularly those with limited institutional data support, promoting equitable participation in environmental science. The scalable framework offers a model for other repositories, improving the connected environmental data ecosystem.

## Broader Impacts

Plain-language metrics and transparent interface aids environmental education and literacy. Cross-repository comparisons can identify patterns for new checks or standard improvements. The reproducible design fosters collaboration among repository teams and advances community standards for FAIR data.
